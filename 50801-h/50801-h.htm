<p><i>Forty years ago, you and I, having made preparation together, entered college
on the same day. We later found different spheres in the world; and you came
back to Cambridge in due time to assume your high office. Twelve years ago,
sought by you, I likewise came, to discharge a duty under you.</i></p>

<p><i>You took me away from many cares, and transferred me to the more congenial
service of the University. The change has conduced to the progress of
those studies in which I hardly remember to have had a lack of interest.</i></p>

<p><i>So I owe much to you; and it is not, I trust, surprising that I desire to connect,
in this work, your name with that of your</i></p>

<h3>PART I. AMERICANA IN LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap06">HARRISSE, in the Introduction of his <i>Bibliotheca
Americana Vetustissima</i>, enumerates
and characterizes many of the bibliographies of
Americana, beginning with the chapter, “De
Scriptoribus rerum Americanarum,” in the <i>Bibliotheca
Classica</i> of Draudius, in 1622.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> De Laet,
in his <i>Nieuwe Wereldt</i> (1625), gives a list of
about thirty-seven authorities, which he increased
somewhat in later editions.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The earliest
American catalogue of any moment, however,
came from a native Peruvian, Léon y Pinelo,
who is usually cited by the latter name only.
He had prepared an extensive list; but he
published at Madrid, in 1629, a selection of
titles only, under the designation of <i>Epitome
de la biblioteca oriental i occidental</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which included
manuscripts as well as books. He had
exceptional advantages as chronicler of the
Indies.</p>

<p>In 1671, in Montanus’s <i>Nieuwe weereld</i>, and
in Ogilby’s <i>America</i>, about 167 authorities are
enumerated.</p>

<p>Sabin<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> refers to Cornelius van Beughem’s
<i>Bibliographia Historica</i>, 1685, published at Amsterdam,
as having the titles of books on America.</p>

<p>The earliest exclusively American catalogue
is the <i>Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordia</i> of White
Kennett,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Bishop of Peterborough, published in
London in 1713. The arrangement of its sixteen
hundred entries is chronological; and it enters
under their respective dates the sections of such
collections as Hakluyt and Ramusio.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It particularly
pertains to the English colonies, and
more especially to New England, where, in the
eighteenth century, three distinctively valuable
American libraries are known to have existed,&mdash;that
of the Mather family, which was in large
part destroyed during the battle of Bunker Hill,
in 1775; that of Thomas Prince, still in large
part existing in the Boston Public Library; and
that of Governor Hutchinson, scattered by the
mob which attacked his house in Boston in
1765.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In 1716 Lenglet du Fresnoy inserted a brief
list (sixty titles) in his <i>Méthode pour étudier la
géographie</i>. Garcia’s <i>Origen de los Indias de el
nuevo mundo</i>, Madrid, 1729, shows a list of about
seventeen hundred authors.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1737-1738 Barcia enlarged Pinelo’s work,
translating all his titles into Spanish, and added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mii" id="Page_mii">[ii]</a></span>
numerous other entries which Rich<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> says were
“clumsily thrown together.”</p>

<p>Charlevoix prefixed to his <i>Nouvelle France</i>,
in 1744, a list with useful comments, which the
English reader can readily approach in Dr.
Shea’s translation. A price-list which has been
preserved of the sale in Paris in 1764, <i>Catalogue
des livres des ci-devant soi-disans Jésuites du Collége
de Clermont</i>, indicates the lack of competition at
that time for those choicer Americana, now so
costly.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The <i>Regio patronatu Indiarum</i> of Frassus
(1775) gives about 1505 authorities. There
is a chronological catalogue of books issued in
the American colonies previous to 1775, prepared
by S. F. Haven, Jr., and appended to the
edition of Thomas’s <i>History of Printing</i>, published
by the American Antiquarian Society.
Though by no means perfect, it is a convenient
key to most publications illustrative of American
history during the colonial period of the English
possessions, and printed in America. Dr.
Robertson’s <i>America</i> (1777) shows only 250
works, and it indicates how far short he was of
the present advantages in the study of this subject.
Clavigero surpassed all his predecessors
in the lists accompanying his <i>Storia del Messico</i>,
published in 1780,&mdash;but the special bibliography
of Mexico is examined elsewhere. Equally special,
and confined to the English colonies, is the
documentary register which Jefferson inserted
in his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>; but it serves to show
how scanty the records were a hundred years ago
compared with the calendars of such material
now. Meuzel, in 1782, had published enough of
his <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> to cover the American
field, though he never completed the work as
planned.</p>

<p>In 1789 an anonymous <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>
of nearly sixteen hundred entries was published
in London. It is not of much value. Harrisse
and others attribute it to Reid; but by some the
author’s name is differently given as Homer,
Dalrymple, and Long.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>An enumeration of the documentary sources
(about 152 entries) used by Muñoz in his <i>Historia
del nuevo mundo</i> (1793) is given in Fustér’s <i>Biblioteca
Valenciana</i> (ii. 202-234) published at Valencia
in 1827-1830.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>There is in the Library of Congress (Force
Collection) a copy of an <i>Indice de la Coleccion de
manuscritos pertinecientes a la historia de las Indias</i>,
by Fraggia, Abella, and others, dated at
Madrid, 1799.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In the Sparks collection at Cornell are two
other manuscript bibliographies worthy of notice.
One is a <i>Biblioteca Americana</i>, by Antonio
de Alcedo, dated in 1807. Sparks says his copy
was made in 1843 from an original which Obadiah
Rich had found in Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Harrisse says that another copy is in the
Carter-Brown Library; and he asserts that, excepting
some additions of modern American
authors, it is not much improved over Barcia’s
edition of Pinelo. H. H. Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> mentions
having a third copy, which had formerly belonged
to Prescott.</p>

<p>The other manuscript at Cornell is a <i>Bibliotheca
Americana</i>, prepared in twelve volumes
by Arthur Homer, who had intended, but never
accomplished, the publication of it. Sparks
found it in Sir Thomas Phillipps’s library at
Middlehill, and caused the copy of it to be
made, which is now at Ithaca.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In 1808 Boucher de la Richarderie published
at Paris his <i>Bibliothèque universelle
des voyages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which has in the fifth part a
critical list of all voyages to American waters.
Harrisse disagrees with Peignot in his
favorable estimate of Richarderie, and traces
to him the errors of Faribault and later
bibliographers.</p>

<p>The <i>Bibliotheca Hispano-Americana</i> of Dr.
José Mariano Beristain de Souza was published
in Mexico in 1816-1821, in three volumes.
Quaritch, pricing it at £96 in 1880,
calls it the rarest and most valuable of all
American bibliographical works. It is a notice
of writers who were born, educated, or flourished
in Spanish America, and naturally covers much
of interest to the historical student. The author
did not live to complete it, and his nephew
finished it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_miii" id="Page_miii">[iii]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1818 Colonel Israel Thorndike, of Boston,
bought for $6,500 the American library of Professor
Ebeling, of Germany, estimated to contain
over thirty-two hundred volumes, besides
an extraordinary collection of ten thousand
maps.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The library was given by the purchaser
to Harvard College, and its possession
at once put the library of that institution
at the head of all libraries in the
United States for the illustration of American
history. No catalogue of it was ever
printed, except as a part of the General
Catalogue of the College Library issued
in 1830-1834, in five volumes.</p>

<p>Another useful collection of Americana
added to the same library was that formed
by David B. Warden, for forty years
United States Consul at Paris, who printed
a catalogue of its twelve hundred volumes
at Paris, in 1820, called <i>Bibliotheca Americo-Septentrionalis</i>.
The collection in 1823
found a purchaser at $5,000, in Mr. Samuel
A. Eliot, who gave it to the College.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="floatright">

</div></div>

<p>The Harvard library, however, as well
as several of the best collections of Americana
in the United States, owes more,
perhaps, to Obadiah Rich than to any
other. This gentleman, a native of Boston,
was born in 1783. He went as consul of
the United States to Valencia in 1815, and
there began his study of early Spanish-American
history, and undertook the gathering
of a remarkable collection of books,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which
he threw open generously, with his own kindly
assistance, to every investigator who visited
Spain for purposes of study. Here he won the
respect of Alexander H. Everett, then American
minister to the court of Spain. He captivated
Irving by his helpful nature, who says of him:
“Rich was one of the most indefatigable, intelligent,
and successful bibliographers in Europe.
His house at Madrid was a literary wilderness,
abounding with curious works and rare editions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_miv" id="Page_miv">[iv]</a></span>
... He was withal a man of great truthfulness
and simplicity of character, of an amiable and
obliging disposition and strict integrity.” Similar
was the estimation in which he was held by
Ticknor, Prescott, George Bancroft, and many
others, as Allibone has recorded.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In 1828 he removed
to London, where he established himself
as a bookseller. From this period, as Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
fitly says, it was under his influence, acting upon
the lovers of books among his compatriots, that
the passion for forming collections of books
exclusively American grew up.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In those days the
cost of books now esteemed rare was trifling
compared with the prices demanded at present.
Rich had a prescience in his calling, and the
beginnings of the great libraries of Colonel
Aspinwall, Peter Force, James Lenox, and John
Carter Brown were made under his fostering
eye; which was just as kindly vigilant for Grenville,
who was then forming out of the income
of his sinecure office the great collection which
he gave to the British nation in recompense for
his support.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In London, watching the book-markets
and making his catalogue, Rich continued
to live for the rest of his life (he died in
February, 1850), except for a period when he
was the United States consul at Port Mahon in
the Balearic Islands. His bibliographies are still
valuable, his annotations in them are trustworthy,
and their records are the starting-points of the
growth of prices. His issues and reissues of
them are somewhat complicated by supplements
and combinations, but collectors and bibliographers
place them on their shelves in the
following order:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">1. <i>A Catalogue of books relating principally to America,
arranged under the years in which they were printed</i>
(1500-1700), London, 1832. This included four hundred
and eighty-six numbers, those designated by a star without
price being understood to be in Colonel Aspinwall’s collection.
Two small supplements were added to this.</p>

<p>2. <i>Bibliotheca Americana Nova, printed since 1700
(to 1800)</i>, London, 1835. Two hundred and fifty copies
were printed. A supplement appeared in 1841, and this
became again a part of his.</p>

<p>3. <i>Bibliotheca Americana Nova</i>, vol. i. (1701-1800);
vol. ii. (1801-1844), which was printed (250 copies) in London
in 1846.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">It was in 1833 that Colonel Thomas Aspinwall,
of Boston, who was for thirty-eight years
the American consul at London, printed at Paris
a catalogue of his collection of Americana,
where seven hundred and seventy-one lots included,
beside much that was ordinarily useful,
a great number of the rarest of books on American
history. Harrisse has called Colonel Aspinwall,
not without justice, “a bibliophile of great
tact and activity.” All but the rarest part of
his collection was subsequently burned in 1863,
when it had passed into the hands of Mr. Samuel
L. M. Barlow,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of New York.</p>

<p>M. Ternaux-Compans, who had collected&mdash;as
Mr. Brevoort thinks<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;the most extensive
library of books on America ever brought together,
printed his <i>Bibliothèque Américaine</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in
1837 at Paris. It embraced 1,154 works, arranged
chronologically, and all of them of a date before
1700. The titles were abridged, and accompanied
by French translations. His annotations
were scant; and other students besides Rich
have regretted that so learned a man had not
more benefited his fellow-students by ampler
notes.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Also in 1837 appeared the <i>Catalogue d’ouvrages
sur l’histoire de l’Amérique</i>, of G. B. Faribault,
which was published at Quebec, and was
more specially devoted to books on New
France.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>With the works of Rich and Ternaux the
bibliography of Americana may be considered
to have acquired a distinct recognition; and
the succeeding survey of this field may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mv" id="Page_mv">[v]</a></span>
more conveniently made if we group the contributors
by some broad discriminations of the
motives influencing them, though such distinctions
sometimes become confluent.</p>

<p>First, as regards what may be termed professional
bibliography. One of the earliest
workers in the new spirit was a Dresden jurist,
Hermann E. Ludewig, who came to the United
States in 1844, and prepared an account of the
<i>Literature of American local history</i>, which was
published in 1846. This was followed by a
supplement, pertaining wholly to New York
State, which appeared in <i>The Literary World</i>,
February 19, 1848. He had previously published
in the <i>Serapeum</i> at Leipsic (1845, pp. 209)
accounts of American libraries and bibliography,
which were the first contributions to this
subject.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Some years later, in 1858, there was
published in London a monograph on <i>The Literature
of the American Aboriginal Linguistics</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
which had been undertaken by Mr. Ludewig
but had not been carried through the press,
when he died, Dec. 12, 1856.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>We owe to a Franco-American citizen the
most important bibliography which we have
respecting the first half century of American
history; for the <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>
only comes down to 1551 in its chronological
arrangement. Mr. Brevoort<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> very
properly characterizes it as “a work which
lightens the labors of such as have to investigate
early American history.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It was under the hospitable roof of Mr. Barlow’s
library in New York that, “having gloated
for years over second-hand compilations,” Harrisse
says that he found himself “for the first
time within reach of the fountain-heads of history.”
Here he gathered the materials for his
<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, which were, as he says, like
“pencil marks varnished over.” These first
appeared less perfectly than later, in the <i>New
York Commercial Advertiser</i>, under the title of
“Columbus in a Nut-shell.” Mr. Harrisse had
also prepared (four copies only printed) for Mr.
Barlow in 1864 the <i>Bibliotheca Barlowiana</i>,
which is a descriptive catalogue of the rarest
books in the Barlow-Aspinwall Collection, touching
especially the books on Virginian and New
England history between 1602 and 1680.</p>

<p>Mr. Barlow now (1864) sumptuously printed
the <i>Notes on Columbus</i> in a volume (ninety-nine
copies) for private distribution. For some reason
not apparent, there were expressions in this
admirable treatise which offended some; as
when, for instance (p. vii), he spoke of being
debarred the privileges of a much-vaunted public
library, referring to the Astor Library. Similar
inadvertences again brought him hostile
criticism, when two years later (1866) he printed
with considerable typographical luxury his
<i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>, which was
published in New York. It embraces something
over three hundred entries.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The work
is not without errors; and Mr. Henry Stevens,
who claims that he was wrongly accused in the
book, gave it a bad name in the <i>London Athenæum</i>
of Oct. 6, 1866, where an unfortunate
slip, in making “Ander Schiffahrt”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> a personage,
is unmercifully ridiculed. A committee of
the Société de Géographie in Paris, of which
M. Ernest Desjardins was spokesman, came to
the rescue, and printed a <i>Rapport sur les deux
ouvrages de bibliographie Américaine de M. Henri
Harrisse</i>, Paris, 1867. In this document the
claim is unguardedly made that Harrisse’s book
was the earliest piece of solid erudition which
America had produced,&mdash;a phrase qualified later
as applying to works of American bibliography
only. It was pointed out that while for the
period of 1492-1551 Rich had given twenty
titles, and Ternaux fifty-eight, Harrisse had
enumerated three hundred and eight.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Harrisse prepared, while shut up in Paris
during the siege of 1870, his <i>Notes sur la Nouvelle
France</i>, a valuable bibliographical essay
referred to elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He later put in shape
the material which he had gathered for a supplemental
volume to his <i>Bibliotheca Americana
Vetustissima</i>, which he called <i>Additions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and
published it in Paris in 1872. In his introduction
to this latter volume he shows how
thoroughly he has searched the libraries of
Europe for new evidences of interest in America
during the first half century after its discovery.
He notes the depredations upon the older
libraries which have been made in recent years,
since the prices for rare Americana have ruled
so high. He finds<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> that the Biblioteca Colombina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvi" id="Page_mvi">[vi]</a></span>
at Seville, as compared with a catalogue of
it made by Ferdinand Columbus himself, has
suffered immense losses. “It is curious to notice,”
he finally says, “how few of the original
books relating to the early history of the New
World can be found in the public libraries of
Europe. There is not a literary institution,
however rich and ancient, which in this respect
could compare with three or four private
libraries in America. The Marciana at Venice
is probably the richest. The Trivulgiana at
Milan can boast of several great rarities.”</p>

<p>For the third contributor to the recent bibliography
of Americana, we must still turn to an
adopted citizen, Joseph Sabin, an Englishman
by birth. Various publishing enterprises of
interest to the historical student are associated
with Mr. Sabin’s name. He published a quarto
series of reprints of early American tracts,
eleven in number, and an octavo series, seven
in number.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He published for several years,
beginning in 1869, the <i>American Bibliopolist</i>, a
record of new books, with literary miscellanies,
largely upon Americana. In 1867 he began the
publication (five hundred copies) of the most
extensive American bibliography yet made, <i>A
Dictionary of books relating to America, from its
discovery to the present time</i>. The author’s death,
in 1881,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> left the work somewhat more than half
done, and it has been continued since his death
by his sons.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Notas Para una bibliografia de obras
anonimas i seudonimas</i> of Diego Barros Arana,
published at Santiago de Chile in 1882, five hundred
and seven books on America (1493-1876),
without authors, are traced to their writers.</p>

<p class="p2">As a second class of contributors to the
bibliographical records of America, we must
reckon the students who have gathered libraries
for use in pursuing their historical studies.
Foremost among such, and entitled to be
esteemed a pioneer in the modern spirit of
research, is Alexander von Humboldt. He
published his <i>Examen critique de l’histoire de la
géographie du nouveau continent</i>,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in five volumes,
between 1836 and 1839.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> “It is,” says Brevoort,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
“a guide which all must consult. With a master
hand the author combines and collates all
attainable materials, and draws light from
sources which <i>he</i> first brings to bear in his
exhaustive investigations.” Harrisse calls it
“the greatest monument ever erected to the
early history of this continent.”</p>

<p>Humboldt’s library was bought by Henry
Stevens, who printed in 1863, in London, a
catalogue of it, showing 11,164 entries; but this
was not published till 1870. It included a set
of the <i>Examen critique</i>, with corrections, and the
notes for a new sixth volume.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Harrisse, who
it is believed contemplated at one time a new
edition of this book, alleges that through the
remissness of the purchaser of the library the
world has lost sight of these precious memorials
of Humboldt’s unperfected labors. Stevens, in
the <i>London Athenæum</i>, October, 1866, rebuts the
charge.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Of the collection of books and manuscripts
formed by Col. Peter Force we have no separate
record, apart from their making a portion
of the general catalogue of the Library
of Congress, the Government having bought
the collection in 1867.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The library which Jared Sparks formed
during the progress of his historical labors was
sold about 1872 to Cornell University, and is
now at Ithaca. Mr. Sparks left behind him
“imperfect but not unfaithful lists of his books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvii" id="Page_mvii">[vii]</a></span>”
which, after some supervision by Dr. Cogswell
and others, were put in shape for the press by
Mr. Charles A. Cutter of the Boston Athenæum,
and were printed, in 1871, as <i>Catalogue of the
Library of Jared Sparks</i>. In the appendix was
a list of the historical manuscripts, originals and
copies, which are now on deposit in Harvard
College Library.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In 1849 Mr. H. R. Schoolcraft<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> printed, at
the expense of the United States Government,
a <i>Bibliographical Catalogue of books, etc., in the
Indian tongues of the United States</i>,&mdash;a list later
reprinted with additions in his <i>Indian Tribes</i> (in
1851), vol. iv.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In 1861 Mr. Ephraim George Squier published
at New York a monograph on authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mviii" id="Page_mviii">[viii]</a></span>
who had written in the languages of Central
America, enumerating one hundred and ten, with
a list of the books and manuscripts on the
history, the aborigines, and the antiquities of
Central America, borrowed from other sources
in part. At the sale of Mr. Squier’s library in
1876, the catalogue<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of which was made by Mr.
Sabin, the entire collection of his manuscripts
fell, as mentioned elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> into the hands of
Mr. Hubert Howe Bancroft of San Francisco.</p>

<p>Probably the largest collection of books and
manuscripts<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which any American has formed
for use in writing is that which belongs to Mr.
Bancroft. He is the organizer of an extensive
series of books on the antiquities and history
of the Pacific coast. To accomplish an examination
of the aboriginal and civilized history of
so large a field<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> as thoroughly as he has unquestionably
made it, within a lifetime, was
a bold undertaking, to be carried out in a centre
of material rather than of literary enterprise.
The task involved the gathering of a library
of printed books, at a distance from the purely
intellectual activity of the country, and where
no other collection of moment existed to supplement
it. It required the seeking and making
of manuscripts, from the labor of which one
might well shrink. It was fortunate that during
the gathering of this collection some notable collections&mdash;like
those of Maximilian,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Ramirez,
and Squier, not to name others&mdash;were opportunely
brought to the hammer, a chance by
which Mr. Bancroft naturally profited.</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft had been trained in the business
habits of the book trade, in which he had
established himself in San Francisco as early as
1856.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> He was at this time twenty-four years
old, having been born of New England stock
in Ohio in 1832, and having had already four
years residence&mdash;since 1852&mdash;in San Francisco
as the agent of an eastern bookseller. It was
not till 1869 that he set seriously to work on his
history, and organized a staff of assistants.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
They indexed his library, which was now large
(12,000 volumes) and was kept on an upper floor
of his business quarters, and they classified the
references in paper bags.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> His first idea was to
make an encyclopædia of the antiquities and history
of the Pacific Coast; and it is on the whole
unfortunate that he abandoned the scheme, for
his methods were admirably adapted to that end,
but of questionable application to a sustained
plan of historical treatment. It is the encyclopedic
quality of his work, as the user eliminates
what he wishes, which makes and will continue
to make the books that pass under his name of
the first importance to historical students.</p>

<p>In 1875 the first five volumes of the series,
denominated by themselves <i>The Native Races of
the Pacific States</i>, made their appearance. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mix" id="Page_mix">[ix]</a></span>
clear that a new force had been brought to bear
upon historical research,&mdash;the force of organized
labor from many hands; and this implied
competent administrative direction and ungrudged
expenditure of money. The work
showed the faults of such a method, in a want
of uniform discrimination, and in that promiscuous
avidity of search, which marks rather an
eagerness to amass than a judgment to select,
and give literary perspective. The book, however,
was accepted as extremely useful and
promising to the future inquirer. Despite a
certain callowness of manner, the <i>Native Races</i>
was extremely creditable, with comparatively
little of the patronizing and flippant air which
its flattering reception has since begotten in its
author or his staff. An unfamiliarity with the
amenities of literary life seems unexpectedly to
have been more apparent also in his later work.</p>

<p>In April, 1876, Mr. Lewis H. Morgan printed
in the <i>North American Review</i>, under the title
of “Montezuma’s Dinner,” a paper in which he
controverted the views expressed in the <i>Native
Races</i> regarding the kind of aboriginal civilization
belonging to the Mexican and Central
American table-lands. A writer of Mr. Morgan’s
reputation commanded respect in all but
Mr. Bancroft, who has been unwise enough
to charge him with seeking “to gain notoriety
by attacking” his (Mr. B.’s) views or supposed
views. He dares also to characterize so well-known
an authority as “a person going about
from one reviewer to another begging condemnation
for my <i>Native Races</i>.” It was this ungracious
tone which produced a divided reception
for his new venture. This, after an interval
of seven years, began to make its appearance in
vol. vi. of the “Works,” or vol. i. of the <i>History
of Central America</i>, appearing in the autumn of
1882.</p>

<p>The changed tone of the new series, its
rhetoric, ambitious in parts, but mixed with
passages which are often forceful and exact,
suggestive of an ill-assorted conjoint production;
the interlarding of classic allusions by
some retained reviser who served this purpose
for one volume at least; a certain cheap reasoning
and ranting philosophy, which gives place at
times to conceptions of grasp; flippancy and
egotism, which induce a patronizing air under
the guise of a constrained adulation of others;
a want of knowledge on points where the system
of indexing employed by his staff had been
deficient,&mdash;these traits served to separate the
criticism of students from the ordinary laudation
of such as were dazed by the magnitude of the
scheme.</p>

<p>Two reviews challenging his merits on these
grounds<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> induced Mr. Bancroft to reply in a
tract<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> called <i>The Early American Chroniclers</i>.
The manner of this rejoinder is more offensive
than that of the volumes which it defends; and
with bitter language he charges the reviewers
with being “men of Morgan,” working in concert
to prejudice his success.</p>

<p>But the controversy of which record is here
made is unworthy of the principal party to it.
His important work needs no such adventitious
support; and the occasion for it might have
been avoided by ordinary prudence. The extent
of the library upon which the work<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> is based,
and the full citation of the authorities followed
in his notes, and the more general enumeration
of them in his preliminary lists, make the work
pre-eminent for its bibliographical extent, however
insufficient, and at times careless, is the
bibliographical record.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The library formed by the late Henry C.
Murphy of Brooklyn to assist him in his projected
history of maritime discovery in America,
of which only the chapter on Verrazano<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> has
been printed, was the creation of diligent search
for many years, part of which was spent in
Holland as minister of the United States. The
earliest record of it is a <i>Catalogue of an American
library chronologically arranged</i>, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mx" id="Page_mx">[x]</a></span>
privately printed in a few copies, about 1850, and
showed five hundred and eighty-nine entries
between the years 1480 and 1800.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>There has been no catalogue printed of the
library of Mr. James Carson Brevoort, so well
known as a historical student and bibliographer,
to whom Mr. Sabin dedicated the first volume of
his <i>Dictionary</i>. Some of the choicer portions
of his collection are understood to have become
a part of the Astor Library, of which Mr. Brevoort
was for a few years the superintendent, as
well as a trustee.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The useful and choice collection of Mr.
Charles Deane, of Cambridge, Mass., to which,
as the reader will discover, the Editor has often
had recourse, has never been catalogued. Mr.
Deane has made excellent use of it, as his tracts
and papers abundantly show.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p class="p2">A distinct class of helpers in the field of
American bibliography has been those gatherers
of libraries who are included under the somewhat
indefinite term of collectors,&mdash;owners of
books, but who make no considerable dependence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxi" id="Page_mxi">[xi]</a></span>
upon them for studies which lead to publication.
From such, however, in some instances,
bibliography has notably gained,&mdash;as in the
careful knowledge which Mr. James Lenox sometimes
dispensed to scholars either in privately
printed issues or in the pages of periodicals.</p>

<p>Harrisse in 1866 pointed to five Americana
libraries in the United States as surpassing all
of their kind in Europe,&mdash;the Carter-Brown,
Barlow, Force, Murphy, and Lenox collections.
Of the Barlow, Force (now in the Library of
Congress), and Murphy collections mention has
already been made.</p>

<p>The Lenox Library is no longer private,
having been given to a board of trustees by Mr.
Lenox previous to his death,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and handsomely
housed, by whom it is held for a restricted public
use, when fully catalogued and arranged. Its
character, as containing only rare or unusual
books, will necessarily withdraw it from the
use of all but scholars engaged in recondite
studies. It is very rich in other directions than
American history; but in this department the
partial access which Harrisse had to it while
in Mr. Lenox’s house led him to infer that it
would hold the first rank. The wealth of its
alcoves, with their twenty-eight thousand volumes,
is becoming known gradually in a series
of bibliographical monographs, printed as contributions
to its catalogue, of which six have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxii" id="Page_mxii">[xii]</a></span>
thus far appeared, some of them clearly and
mainly the work of Mr. Lenox himself.</p>

<p>Of these only three have illustrated American
history in any degree,&mdash;those devoted to
the voyages of Hulsius and Thévenot, and to the
Jesuit Relations (Canada).<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The only rival of the Lenox is the library of
the late John Carter Brown, of Providence, gathered
largely under the supervision of John Russell
Bartlett; and since Mr. Brown’s death it
has been more particularly under the same oversight.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
It differs from the Lenox Library in that
it is exclusively American, or nearly so,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and
still more in that we have access to a thorough
catalogue of its resources, made by Mr. Bartlett
himself, and sumptuously printed.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> It was originally
issued as <i>Bibliotheca Americana: A Catalogue
of books relating to North and South America
in the Library of John Carter Brown of Providence,
with notes by John Russell Bartlett</i>, in three
volumes,&mdash;vol. i., 1493-1600, in 1865 (302 entries);
vol. ii., 1601-1700, in 1866 (1,160 entries);
vol. iii., 1701-1800, in two parts, in 1870-1871
(4,173 entries).</p>

<p>In 1875 vol. i. was reprinted with fuller titles,
covering the years 1482<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>-1601, with 600 entries,
doubling the extent of that portion.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Numerous
facsimiles of titles and maps add much to
its value. A second and similarly extended edition
of vol. ii. (1600-1700) was printed in 1882,
showing 1,642 entries. The <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
as it is ordinarily cited, is the most extensive
printed list of all Americana previous to
1800, more especially anterior to 1700, which now
exists.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Of the other important American catalogues,
the first place is to be assigned to that of the
collection formed at Hartford by Mr. George
Brinley, the sale of which since his death<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> has
been undertaken under the direction of Dr. J.
Hammond Trumbull,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> who has prepared the catalogue,
and who claims&mdash;not without warrant&mdash;that
it embraces “a greater number of volumes
remarkable for their rarity, value, and interest
to special collectors and to book-lovers in general,
than were ever before brought together in
an American sale-room.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The library of William Menzies, of New York,
was sold in 1875, from a catalogue made by
Joseph Sabin.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The library of Edward A.
Crowninshield, of Boston, was catalogued in Boston
in 1859, but withdrawn from public sale,
and sold to Henry Stevens, who took a portion
of it to London. It was not large,&mdash;the catalogue
shows less than 1,200 titles,&mdash;and was
not exclusively American; but it was rich in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxiii" id="Page_mxiii">[xiii]</a></span>
some of the rarest of such books, particularly in
regard to the English Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The sale of John Allan’s collection in New
York, in 1864, was a noteworthy one. Americana,
however, were but a portion of the collection.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
An English-American flavor of far less fineness,
but represented in a catalogue showing a very
large collection of books and pamphlets,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> was
sold in New York in May, 1870, as the property
of Mr. E. P. Boon.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas W. Field issued in 1873 <i>An
Essay towards an Indian Bibliography, being a
Catalogue of books relating to the American Indians</i>,
in his own library, with a few others
which he did not possess, distinguished by an
asterisk. Mr. Field added many bibliographical
and historical notes, and gave synopses, so that
the catalogue is generally useful to the student
of Americana, as he did not confine his survey
to works dealing exclusively with the aborigines.
The library upon which this bibliography was
based was sold at public auction in New York,
in two parts, in May, 1875 (3,324 titles), according
to a catalogue which is a distinct publication
from the <i>Essay</i>.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The collection of Mr. Almon W. Griswold
was dispersed by printed catalogues in 1876 and
1880, the former containing the American portion,
rich in many of the rarer books.</p>

<p>Of the various private collections elsewhere
than in the United States, more or less rich in
Americana, mention may be made of the <i>Bibliotheca
Mejicana</i><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> of Augustin Fischer, London,
1869; of the Spanish-American libraries of Gregorio
Beéche, whose catalogue was printed at
Valparaiso in 1879; and that of Benjamin Vicuña
Mackenna, printed at the same place in
1861.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In Leipsic, the catalogue of Serge Sobolewski
(1873)<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> was particularly helpful in the
bibliography of Ptolemy, and in the voyages of
De Bry and others. Some of the rarest of
Americana were sold in the Sunderland sale<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
in London in 1881-1883; and remarkably rich
collections were those of Pinart and Bourbourg,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
sold in Paris in 1883, and that of Dr. J. Court,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
the first part of which was sold in Paris in May,
1884. The second part had little of interest.</p>

<p class="p2">Still another distinctive kind of bibliographies
is found in the catalogues of the better
class of dealers; and among the best of such is to
be placed the various lists printed by Henry Stevens,
a native of Vermont, who has spent most
of his manhood in London. In the dedication
to John Carter Brown of his <i>Schedule of Nuggets</i>
(1870), he gives some account of his early bibliographical
quests.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Two years after graduating
at Yale, he says, he had passed “at Cambridge,
reading passively with legal Story, and actively
with historical Sparks, all the while sifting and
digesting the treasures of the Harvard Library.
For five years previously he had scouted through
several States during his vacations, prospecting
in out-of-the-way places for historical nuggets,
mousing through town libraries and country garrets
in search of anything old that was historically
new for Peter Force and his American
Archives.... From Vermont to Delaware many
an antiquated churn, sequestered hen-coop, and
dilapidated flour-barrel had yielded to him rich
harvests of old papers, musty books, and golden
pamphlets. Finally, in 1845, an irrefragable
desire impelled him to visit the Old World, its
libraries and book-stalls. Mr. Brown’s enlightened
liberality in those primitive years of his
bibliographical pupilage contributed largely towards
the boiling of his kettle.... In acquiring
<i>con amore</i> these American Historiadores Primitivos,
he ... travelled far and near. In this
labor of love, this journey of life, his tracks often
become your tracks, his labors your works, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxiv" id="Page_mxiv">[xiv]</a></span><i>libri</i> your <i>liberi</i>,” he adds, in addressing Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>In 1848 Mr. Stevens proposed the publication,
through the Smithsonian Institution, of a
general <i>Bibliographia Americana</i>, illustrating the
sources of early American history;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> but the project
failed, and one or more attempts later made
to begin the work also stopped short of a beginning.
While working as a literary agent of
the Smithsonian Institution and other libraries,
in these years, and beginning that systematic
selection of American books, for the British
Museum and Bodleian, which has made these
libraries so nearly, if not quite, the equal of any
collection of Americana in the United States, he
also made the transcriptions and indexes of the
documents in the State Paper Office which respectively
concern the States of New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Maryland, and Virginia. These
labors are now preserved in the archives of those
States.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Perhaps the earliest of his sale catalogues
was that of a pseudo “Count Mondidier,”
embracing Americana, which were sold in
London in December, 1851.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> His <i>English Library</i>
in 1853 was without any distinctive American
flavor; but in 1854 he began, but suspended
after two numbers, the <i>American Bibliographer</i>
(100 copies).<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In 1856 he prepared a <i>Catalogue
of American Books and Maps in the British Museum</i>
(20,000 titles), which, however, was never
regularly published, but copies bear date 1859,
1862, and 1866.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In 1858&mdash;though most copies
are dated 1862<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>&mdash;appeared his <i>Historical Nuggets;
Bibliotheca Americana, or a descriptive Account
of my Collection of rare books relating to America</i>.
The two little volumes show about three thousand
titles, and Harrisse says they are printed
“with remarkable accuracy.” There was begun
in 1885, in connection with his son Mr. Henry
Newton Stevens, a continuation of these <i>Nuggets</i>.
In 1861 a sale catalogue of his <i>Bibliotheca
Americana</i> (2,415 lots), issued by Puttick and
Simpson, and in part an abridgment of the <i>Nuggets</i>
with similarly careful collations, was accepted
by Maisonneuve as the model of his <i>Bibliothèque
Américaine</i> later to be mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In 1869-1870 Mr. Stevens visited America, and
printed at New Haven his <i>Historical and Geographical
Notes on the earliest discoveries in America</i>,
1453-1530, with photo-lithographic facsimiles
of some of the earliest maps. It is a valuable
essay, much referred to, in which the author
endeavored to indicate the entanglement of the
Asiatic and American coast lines in the early
cartography.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>In 1870 he sold at Boston a collection of five
thousand volumes, catalogued as <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
(2,545 entries), being mostly Americana,
from the library of the elder Henry Stevens of
Vermont. It has a characteristic introduction,
with an array of readable notes.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> His catalogues
have often such annotations, inserted on a principle
which he explains in the introduction to
this one: “In the course of many years of bibliographical
study and research, having picked up
various isolated grains of knowledge respecting
the early history, geography, and bibliography
of this western hemisphere, the writer has
thought it well to pigeon-hole the facts in notes
long and short.”</p>

<p>In October, 1870, he printed at London a
<i>Schedule of Two Thousand American Historical
Nuggets taken from the Stevens Diggings in
September, 1870, and set down in Chronological
Order of Printing from 1490 to 1800 [1776], described
and recommended as a Supplement to my
printed Bibliotheca Americana</i>. It included 1,350
titles.</p>

<p>In 1872 he sold another collection, largely
Americana, according to a catalogue entitled
<i>Bibliotheca Geographica &amp; Historica; or, a Catalogue
of [3,109 lots], illustrative of historical geography
and geographical history. Collected, used,
and described, with an Introductory Essay on
Catalogues, and how to make them upon the Stevens
system of photo-bibliography</i>. The title calls
it a first part; but no second part ever appeared.
Ten copies were issued, with about four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxv" id="Page_mxv">[xv]</a></span>
photographic copies of titles inserted. Some
copies are found without the essay.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The next year (1873) he issued a privately
printed list of two thousand titles of American
“Continuations,” as they are called by librarians,
or serial publications in progress as taken at
the British Museum, quaintly terming the list
<i>American books with tails to ’em</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in 1881, he printed Part I. of <i>Stevens’s
Historical Collections</i>, a sale catalogue
showing 1,625 titles of books, chiefly Americana,
and including his Franklin Collection of manuscripts,
which he later privately sold to the
United States Government, an agent of the Boston
Public Library yielding to the nation.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>One of the earliest to establish an antiquarian
bookshop in the United States was the late
Samuel G. Drake, who opened one in Boston in
1830.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> His special field was that of the North
American Indians; and the history and antiquities
of the aborigines, together with the history
of the English Colonies, give a character to his
numerous catalogues.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Mr. Drake died in 1875,
from a cold taken at a sale of the library of
Daniel Webster; and his final collections of
books were scattered in two sales in the following
year.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>William Gowans, of New York, was another
of the early dealers in Americana.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The catalogues
of Bartlett and Welford have already been
mentioned. In 1854, while Garrigue and Christern
were acting as agents of Mr. Lenox, they
printed <i>Livres Curieux</i>, a list of desiderata
sought for by Mr. Lenox, pertaining to such rarities
as the letters of Columbus, Cartier, parts of
De Bry and Hulsius, and the Jesuit Relations.
This list was circulated widely through Europe,
but not twenty out of the 216 titles were ever
offered.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>About 1856, Charles B. Norton, of New
York, began to issue American catalogues; and
in 1857 he established <i>Norton’s Literary Letter</i>,
intended to foster interest in the collection of
Americana.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A little later, Joel Munsell, of
Albany, began to issue catalogues;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and J. W.
Randolph, of Richmond, Virginia, more particularly
illustrated the history of the southern
parts of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The most important
Americana lists at present issued by American
dealers are those of Robert Clarke &amp; Co.,
of Cincinnati, which are admirable specimens of
such lists.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In England, the catalogues of Henry Stevens
and E. G. Allen have been already mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxvi" id="Page_mxvi">[xvi]</a></span>
The leading English dealer at present in the
choicer books of Americana, as of all other subjects&mdash;and
it is not too much to say, the leading
one of the world&mdash;is Mr. Bernard Quaritch,
a Prussian by birth, who was born in 1819,
and after some service in the book-trade in
his native country came to London in 1842,
and entered the service of Henry G. Bohn,
under whose instruction, and as a fellow-employé
of Lowndes the bibliographer, he laid the
foundations of a remarkable bibliographical acquaintance.
A short service in Paris brought
him the friendship of Brunet. Again (1845)
he returned to Mr. Bohn’s shop; but in April,
1847, he began business in London for himself.
He issued his catalogues at once on a
small scale; but they took their well-known
distinctive form in 1848, which they have retained,
except during the interval December,
1854,-May, 1864, when, to secure favorable consideration
in the post-office rates, the serial
was called <i>The Museum</i>. It has been his habit,
at intervals, to collect his occasional catalogues
into volumes, and provide them with an index.
The first of these (7,000 entries) was issued
in 1860. Others have been issued in 1864, 1868,
1870, 1874, 1877 (this with the preceding constituting
one work, showing nearly 45,000 entries
or 200,000 volumes), and 1880 (describing 28,009
books).<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In the preface to this last catalogue
he says: “The prices of useful and
learned books are in all cases moderate; the
prices of palæographical and bibliographical
curiosities are no doubt in most cases high,
that indeed being a natural result of the great
rivalry between English, French, and American
collectors.... A fine copy of any edition of
a book is, and ought to be, more than twice as
costly as any other.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> While the Quaritch
catalogues have been general, they have included
a large share of the rarest Americana,
whose titles have been illustrated with bibliographical
notes characterized by intimate acquaintance
with the secrets of the more curious
lore.</p>

<p>The catalogues of John Russell Smith (1849,
1853, 1865, 1867), and of his successor Alfred
Russell Smith (1871, 1874), are useful aids in
this department.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The <i>Bibliotheca Hispano-Americana</i>
of Trübner, printed in 1870, offered
about thirteen hundred items.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Occasional
reference can be usefully made to the lists of
George Bumstead, Ellis and White, John Camden
Hotten, all of London, and to those of
William George of Bristol. The latest extensive
Americana catalogue is <i>A catalogue of rare
and curious books, all of which relate more or less
to America</i>, on sale by F. S. Ellis, London, 1884.
It shows three hundred and forty-two titles, including
many of the rarer books, which are held
at prices startling even to one accustomed to the
rapid rise in the cost of books of this description.
Many of them were sold by auction in 1885.</p>

<p>In France, since Ternaux, the most important
contribution has come from the house of
Maisonneuve et Cie., by whom the <i>Bibliotheca
Americana</i> of Charles Leclerc has been successively
issued to represent their extraordinary
stock. The first edition was printed in 1867
(1,647 entries), the second in 1878<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> (2,638 entries,
with an admirable index), besides a first
supplement in 1881 (nos. 2,639-3,029). Mr.
Quaritch characterizes it as edited “with admirable
skill and knowledge.”</p>

<p>Less important but useful lists, issued in
France, have been those of Hector Bossange,
Edwin Tross,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and the current <i>Americana</i> series
of Dufossé, which was begun in 1876.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In Holland, most admirable work has been
done by Frederik Muller, of Amsterdam, and by
Mr. Asher, Mr. Tiele, and Mr. Otto Harrassowitz
under his patronage, of which ample accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxvii" id="Page_mxvii">[xvii]</a></span>
are given in another place.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Muller’s
catalogues were begun in 1850, but did not reach
distinctive merit till 1872.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Martin Nijhoff, at
the Hague, has also issued some American catalogues.</p>

<p>In 1858 Muller sold one of his collections of
Americana to Brockhaus, of Leipsic, and the
<i>Bibliothèque Américaine</i> issued by that publisher
in 1861, as representing this collection, was compiled
by one of the editors of the <i>Serapeum</i>,
Paul Trömel, whom Harrisse characterizes
as an “expert bibliographer and trustworthy
scholar.” The list shows 435 entries by a chronological
arrangement (1507-1700). Brockhaus
again, in 1866, issued another American list,
showing books since 1508, arranged topically
(nos. 7,261-8,611). Mr. Otto Harrassowitz, of
Leipsic, a pupil of Muller, of Amsterdam, has
also entered the field as a purveyor of choice
Americana. T. O. Weigel, of Leipsic, issued a
catalogue, largely American, in 1877.</p>

<p class="p2">So well known are the general bibliographies
of Watt, Lowndes, Brunet, Graesse, and others,
that it is not necessary to point out their distinctive
merits.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Students in this field are familiar
with the catalogues of the chief American libraries.
The library of Harvard College has not
issued a catalogue since 1834, though it now prints
bulletins of its current accessions. An admirable
catalogue of the Boston Athenæum brings the
record of that collection down to 1871. The
numerous catalogues of the Boston Public Library
are of much use, especially the distinct
volume given to the Prince Collection. The
Massachusetts Historical Society’s library has
a catalogue printed in 1859-60. There has been
no catalogue of the American Antiquarian Society
since 1837, and the New England Historic Genealogical
Society has never printed any; nor has
the Congregational Library. The State Library
at Boston issued a catalogue in 1880. These libraries,
with the Carter-Brown Library at Providence,
which is courteously opened to students
properly introduced, probably make Boston
within easy distance of a larger proportion of
the books illustrating American history, than
can be reached with equal convenience from any
other literary centre. A book on the private libraries
of Boston was compiled by Luther Farnham
in 1855; but many of the private collections
then existing have since been scattered.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> General
Horatio Rogers has made a similar record
of those in Providence. After the Carter-Brown
Collection, the most valuable of these private
libraries in New England is probably that of Mr.
Charles Deane in Cambridge, of which mention
has already been made. The collection of the
Rev. Henry M. Dexter, D.D., of New Bedford,
is probably unexampled in this country for the
history of the Congregational movement, which
so largely affected the early history of the English
Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Two other centres in the United States are
of the first importance in this respect. In Washington,
with the Library of Congress (of which
a general consolidated catalogue is now printing),
embracing as it does the collection formed
by Col. Peter Force, and supplementing the
archives of the Government, an investigator of
American history is situated extremely favorably.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
In New York the Astor and Lenox libraries,
with those of the New York Historical
Society and American Geographical Society, give
the student great opportunities. The catalogue
of the Astor Library was printed in 1857-66,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxviii" id="Page_mxviii">[xviii]</a></span>
and that of the Historical Society in 1859. No
general catalogue of the Lenox Library has yet
been printed. An account of the private libraries
of New York was published by Dr. Wynne
in 1860. The libraries of the chief importance
at the present time, in respect to American history,
are those of Mr. S. L. M. Barlow in New
York, and of Mr. James Carson Brevoort in
Brooklyn. Mr. Charles H. Kalbfleisch of New
York has a small collection, but it embraces
some of the rarest books. The New York State
Library at Albany is the chief of the libraries of
its class, and its principal characteristic pertains
to American history.</p>

<p>The other chief American cities are of much
less importance as centres for historical research.
The Philadelphia Library and the collection of
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania are hardly
of distinctive value, except in regard to the history
of that State. In Baltimore the library of
the Peabody Institute, of which the first volume
of an excellent catalogue has been printed, and
that of the Maryland Historical Society are
scarcely sufficient for exhaustive research. The
private library of Mr. H. H. Bancroft constitutes
the only important resource of the Pacific
States;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and the most important collection in
Canada is that represented by the catalogue of
the Library of Parliament, which was printed in
1858.</p>

<p>This enumeration is intended only to indicate
the chief places for ease of general
investigation in American history. Other localities
are rich in local helps, and accounts
of such will be found elsewhere in the present
History.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part II.</span> THE EARLY DESCRIPTIONS OF AMERICA AND COLLECTIVE
ACCOUNTS OF THE EARLY VOYAGES THERETO.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap06">OF the earliest collection of voyages of
which we have any mention we possess
only a defective copy, which is in the Biblioteca
Marciana, and is called <i>Libretto de tutta
la navigazione del Rè di Spagna delle isole e terreni
nuovamente scoperti stampato per Vercellese</i>.
It was published at Venice in 1504,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and is said
to contain the first three voyages of Columbus.
This account, together with the narrative of
Cabral’s voyage printed at Rome and Milan,
and an original&mdash;at present unknown&mdash;of
Vespucius’ third voyage, were embodied, with
other matter, in the <i>Paesi novamente retrovati
et novo mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino
intitulato</i>, published at Vicentia in 1507,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and
again possibly at Vicentia in 1508,&mdash;though

<p>While this Zorzi-Montalboddo compilation
was flourishing, an Italian scholar, domiciled in
Spain, was recording, largely at first hand, the
varied reports of the voyages which were then
opening a new existence to the world. This
was Peter Martyr, of whom Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> cites an
early and quaint sketch from Hernando Alonso
de Herrera’s <i>Disputatio adversus Aristotelez</i>
(1517).<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The general historians have always
made due acknowledgment of his service to
them.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Harrisse could find no evidence of Martyr’s
First Decade having been printed at Seville as
early as 1500, as is sometimes stated; but it has
been held that a translation of it,&mdash;though no
copy is now known,&mdash;made by Angelo Trigviano
into Italian was the <i>Libretto de tutta la
navigazione del Rè di Spagna</i>, already mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
The earliest unquestioned edition was
that of 1511, which was printed at Seville with
the title <i>Legatio Babylonica</i>; it contained nine
books and a part of the tenth book of the First
Decade.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> In 1516 a new edition, without map,
was printed at Alcalá in Roman letter. The
part of the tenth book of the First Decade in
the 1511 edition is here annexed to the ninth,
and a new tenth book is added, besides two other
decades, making three in all.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxi" id="Page_mxxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>There exists what has been called a German
version (<i>Die Schiffung mitt dem lanndt der Gulden
Insel</i>) of the First Decade, in which the
supposed author is called Johan von Angliara;
and its date is 1520, or thereabout; but Mr.
Deane, who has the book,
says that it is not Martyr’s.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Some <i>Poemata</i>, which had
originally been included in
the publication of the First
Decade, were separately
printed in 1520.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>At Basle in 1521 appeared
his <i>De nuper sub D. Carolo
repertis insulis</i>, the title of
which is annexed in fac-simile.
Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> has called
it an extract from the Fourth
Decade; and a similar statement
is made in the <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i> (vol. i. no.
67). But Stevens and other
authorities define it as a substitute
for the lost First Letter
of Cortes, touching the
expedition of Grijalva and
the invasion of Mexico; and
it supplements, rather than
overlaps, Martyr’s other narratives.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Mr. Deane contends
that if the Fourth Decade had
then been written, this might
well be considered an abridgment
of it.</p>

<p>The first complete edition
(<i>De orbe novo</i>) of all the eight
decades was published in 1530
at Complutum; and with it is
usually found the map (“Tipus
orbis universalis”) of
Apianus, which originally appeared
in Camer’s <i>Solinus</i> in
1520. In this new issue the
map has its date changed to
1530.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>In 1532, at Paris, appeared
an abridgment in French of
the first three decades, together
with an abstract of Martyr’s <i>De insulis</i>
(Basle, 1521), followed by abridgments of the
printed second and third letters of Cortes,&mdash;the
whole bearing the title, <i>Extraict ov Recveil des

<p>In 1533, at Basle, in folio, we find the first
three decades and the tract of 1521 (<i>De insulis</i>)
united in <i>De rebus oceanicis et orbe novo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>At Venice, in 1534, the <i>Summario de la generale
historia de l’Indie occidentali</i> was a joint
issue of Martyr and Oviedo, under the editing
of Ramusio.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> An edition of Martyr, published

not apparently exist;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> but an edition of 1537
is noted by Sabin.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In 1555 Richard Eden’s
<i>Decades of the Newe Worlde, or West India</i>, appeared
in black-letter at London. It is made up
in large part from Martyr,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and was the basis
of Richard Willes’ edition of Eden in 1577,
which included the first four decades, and an
abridgment of the last four, with additions from
Oviedo and others,&mdash;all under the new name,
<i>The History of Trauayle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>There was an edition again at Cologne in
1574,&mdash;the one which Robertson used.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Three
decades and the <i>De insulis</i> are also included in
a composite folio published at Basle in 1582,
containing also Benzoni and Levinus, all in
German.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The entire eight decades, in Latin,
which had not been printed together since the
Basle edition of 1530, were published in Paris
in 1587 under the editing of Richard Hakluyt,
with the title: <i>De orbe novo Petri Martyris

<p>As illustrating in some sort his more labored
work, the <i>Opus epistolarum Petri Martyris</i> was
first printed at Complutum in 1530.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The letters

an edition which had the care of Ch. Patin, to
which was appended other letters by Fernando

<p>The most extensive of the early collections
was the <i>Novus orbis</i>, which was issued in
separate editions at Basle and Paris in 1532.
Simon Grynæus, a learned professor at Basle,
signed the preface; and it usually passes under
his name. Grynæus was born in Swabia, was a
friend of Luther, visited England in 1531, and
died in Basle, in 1541. The compilation, however,
is the work of a canon of Strasburg,
John Huttich (born about 1480; died, 1544),
but the labor of revision fell on Grynæus.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It
has the first three voyages of Columbus, and
those of Pinzon and Vespucius; the rest of the
book is taken up with the travels of Marco
Polo and his successors to the East.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxv" id="Page_mxxv">[xxv]</a></span>
next appeared in a German translation at Strasburg
in 1534, which was made by Michal Herr,
<i>Die New Welt</i>. It has no map, gives more from
Martyr than the other edition, and substitutes
a preface by Herr for that of Grynæus.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The
original Latin was reproduced at Basle again in
1537, with 1536 in the colophon.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In 1555
another edition was printed at Basle, enlarged
upon the 1537 edition by the insertion of the
second and third of the Cortes letters and some
accounts of efforts in converting the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Those portions relating to America exclusively
were reprinted in the Latin at Rotterdam in
1616.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Sebastian Münster, who was born in 1489,
was forty-three years old when his map of the
world&mdash;which is preserved in the Paris (1532)
edition of the <i>Novus orbis</i>&mdash;appeared. This is
the first time that Münster significantly comes
before us as a describer of the geography of the
New World. Again in 1540 and 1542 he was associated
with the editions of Ptolemy issued at
Basle in those years.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> It is, however, upon his
<i>Cosmographia</i>, among his forty books, that Münster’s
fame chiefly rests. The earliest editions
are extremely rare, and seem not to be clearly
defined by the bibliographers. It appears to
have been originally issued in German, probably
in 1544 at Basle,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> under the mixed title: <i>Cosmographia.

that he had been engaged upon it for eighteen
years, keeping Strabo before him as a model.
To the section devoted to Asia he adds a
few pages “Von den neüwen inseln” (folios<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxvi" id="Page_mxxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>

<p>This account was scant; and
though it was a little enlarged in the second
edition in 1545,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> it remained of small extent
through subsequent editions, and was confined

but a change of title apparently, there were

<p>The best-known collection of voyages of the
sixteenth century is that of Ramusio, whose
third volume&mdash;compiled probably in 1553, and
printed in 1556&mdash;is given exclusively to American
voyages.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> It contains, however, little regarding
Columbus not given by Peter Martyr
and Oviedo, except the letter to Fracastoro.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
In Ramusio the narratives of these early voyages
first got a careful and considerate editor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxix" id="Page_mxxix">[xxix]</a></span>
who at this time was ripe in knowledge and
experience, for he was well beyond sixty,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and
he had given his maturer years to historical
and geographical study. He had at one time
maintained a school for topographical
studies in his own house.
Oviedo tells us of the assistance
Ramusio was to him in his work.
Locke has praised his labors without
stint.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Monardes, one of the distinguished
Spanish physicians of this
time, was busy seeking for the simples
and curatives of the New
World plants, as the adventurers to
New Spain brought them back. The
original issue of his work was the
<i>Dos Libros</i>, published at Seville in
1565, treating “of all things brought
from our West Indies which are
used in medicine, and of the Bezaar
Stone, and the herb Escuerçonera.”
This book is become rare,
and is priced as high as 200 francs
and £9.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The “segunda parte” is
sometimes found separately with the
date 1571; but in 1574 a third part
was printed with the other two,&mdash;making
the complete work, <i>Historia
medicinal de nuestras Indias</i>,&mdash;and
these were again issued in 1580.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>

and Stones, by Doctor Monardus of Sevill, Englished
by John Frampton</i>, which first appeared
in 1577, and was reprinted in 1580, with additions

</div></div>

<p>The great undertaking of De Bry was also
begun towards the close of the same century.
De Bry was an engraver at Frankfort, and his
professional labors had made him acquainted
with works of travel. The influence of Hakluyt
and a visit to the English editor stimulated
him to undertake a task similar to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxi" id="Page_mxxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
the English compiler.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">FEYERABEND.</p>
           <p class="pf400">Sigmund Feyerabend was a prominent bookseller of his day in Frankfort, and was born about 1527 or
1528. He was an engraver himself, and was associated with De Bry in the publications of his <i>Voyages</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>He resolved to include
both the Old and New World; and
he finally produced his volumes simultaneously
in Latin and German. As he gave a larger
size to the American parts than to the others,
the commonly used title, referring to this difference,
was soon established as <i>Grands et petits
voyages</i>.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Theodore De Bry himself died in
March, 1598; but the work was carried forward
by his widow, by his sons John Theodore and
John Israel, and by his sons-in-law Matthew
Merian and William Fitzer. The task was not
finished till 1634, when twenty-five parts had
been printed in the Latin, of which thirteen pertain
to America; but the German has one more
part in the American series. His first part&mdash;which
was Hariot’s <i>Virginia</i>&mdash;was printed not
only in Latin and German, but also in the
original English<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and in French; but there
seeming to be no adequate demand in these
languages, the subsequent issues were confined
to Latin and German. There was a gap in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxii" id="Page_mxxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
dates of publication between 1600 (when the
ninth part is called “postrema pars”) and 1619-1620,
when the tenth and eleventh parts appeared
at Oppenheim, and a twelfth at Frankfort
in 1624. A thirteenth and fourteenth part
appeared in German in 1628 and 1630; and
these, translated together into Latin, completed
the Latin series in 1634.</p>

<p>Without attempting any bibliographical description,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
the succession and editions of the
American parts will be briefly enumerated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1"><b>I.</b> <i>Hariot’s Virginia.</i> In Latin, English, German,
and French, in 1590; four or more impressions of the
Latin the same year. Other editions of the German in
1600 and 1620.</p>

<p><b>II</b>. <i>Le Moyne’s Florida.</i> In Latin, 1591 and 1609; in
German, 1591, 1603.</p>

<p><b>III.</b> <i>Von Staden’s Brazil.</i> In Latin, 1592, 1605, 1630;
in German, 1593 (twice).</p>

<p><b>IV.</b> <i>Benzoni’s New World.</i> In Latin, 1594 (twice),
1644; in German, 1594, 1613.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> <i>Continuation of Benzoni.</i> In Latin, 1595 (twice); in
German, two editions without date, probably 1595 and 1613.</p>

<p><b>VI.</b> <i>Continuation of Benzoni (Peru).</i> In Latin, 1596,
1597, 1617; in German, 1597, 1619.</p>

<p><b>VII.</b> <i>Schmidel’s Brazil.</i> In Latin, 1599, 1625; in
German, 1597, 1600, 1617.</p>

<p><b>VIII.</b> <i>Drake, Candish, and Ralegh.</i> In Latin, 1599
(twice), 1625; in German, 1599, 1624.</p>

<p><b>IX.</b> <i>Acosta</i>, etc. In Latin, 1602, 1633; in German,
probably 1601; “additamentum,” 1602; and again entire
after 1620.</p>

<p><b>X.</b> <i>Vespucius, Hamor, and John Smith.</i> In Latin,
1619 (twice); in German, 1618.</p>

<p><b>XI.</b> <i>Schouten and Spilbergen.</i> In Latin, 1619,&mdash;appendix,
1620; in German, 1619,&mdash;appendix, 1620.</p>

<p><b>XII.</b> <i>Herrera.</i> In Latin, 1624; in German, 1623.</p>

<p><b>XIII.</b> <i>Miscellaneous</i>,&mdash;<i>Cabot</i>, etc. In Latin, 1634;
in German, the first seven sections in 1627 (sometimes
1628); and sections 8-15 in 1630.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Elenchus: Historia Americæ sive Novus orbis</i>, 1634
(three issues). This is a table of the Contents to the edition
which Merian was selling in 1634 under a collective title.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">The foregoing enumeration makes no recognition
of the almost innumerable varieties caused
by combination, which sometimes pass for new
editions. Some of the editions of the same date
are usually called “counterfeits;” and there are
doubts, even, if some of those here named really
deserve recognition as distinct editions.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxiii" id="Page_mxxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>While there is distinctive merit in De Bry’s
collection, which caused it to have a due effect
in its day on the progress of geographical
knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> it must be confessed that a certain
meretricious reputation has become attached
to the work as the test of a collector’s assiduity,
and of his supply of money, quite disproportioned
to the relative use of the collection
in these days to a student. This artificial appreciation
has no doubt been largely due to
the engravings, which form so attractive a feature
in the series, and which, while they in
many cases are the honest rendering of genuine
sketches, are certainly in not a few the merest
fancy of some designer.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>There are several publications of the De
Brys sometimes found grouped with the <i>Voyages</i>
as a part, though not properly so, of the series.
Such are Las Casas’ <i>Narratio regionum Indicarum</i>;
the voyages of the “Silberne Welt,” by
Arthus von Dantzig, and of Olivier van Noort;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
the <i>Rerum et urbis Amstelodamensium historia</i>
of Pontanus, with its Dutch voyages to the
north; and the <i>Navigations aux Indes par les
Hollandois</i>.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Another of De Bry’s editors, Gasper Ens,
published in 1680 his <i>West-unnd-Ost Indischer
Lustgart</i>, which is a summary of the sources
of American history.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>There are various abridgments of De Bry.
The earliest is Ziegler’s <i>America</i>, Frankfort,
1614,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> which is made up from the first nine
parts of the German <i>Grands Voyages</i>. The
<i>Historia antipodum, oder Newe Welt</i> (1631), is
the first twelve parts condensed by Johann
Ludwig Gottfried, otherwise known as Johann
Phillippe Abelin, who was, in Merian’s day,
a co-laborer on the <i>Voyages</i>. He uses a large
number of the plates from the larger work.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
The chief rival collection of De Bry is that of
Hulsius, which is described elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Collections now became numerous. Conrad
Löw’s <i>Meer oder Seehanen Buch</i> was published
at Cologne in 1598.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The Dutch Collection of
Voyages, issued by Cornelius Claesz, appeared
in uniform style between 1598 and 1603, but
it never had a collective title. It gives the
voyages of Cavendish and Drake.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>It was well into the next century (1613) when
Purchas began his publications, of which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxiv" id="Page_mxxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
is an account elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Hieronymus Megiser’s
<i>Septentrio novantiquus</i> was published at
Leipsic in 1613. In a single volume it gave
the Zeni and later accounts of the North, besides
narratives pertaining to New France and
Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The <i>Journalen van de Reysen op
Oostindie</i> of Michael Colijn, published at Amsterdam
in 1619, is called by Muller<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the first
series of voyages published in Dutch with a
collective title. It includes, notwithstanding the
title, Cavendish, Drake, and Raleigh. Another
Dutch folio, Herckmans’ <i>Der Zeevaert lof</i>, etc.
(Amsterdam, 1634), does not include any American
voyages.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The celebrated Dutch collection,
edited by Isaac Commelin, at Amsterdam, and
known as the <i>Begin en Voortgangh van de Oost-Indische
Compagnie</i>, would seem originally to
have included, among its voyages to the East
and North,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> those of Raleigh and Cavendish;
but they were later omitted.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The collection of Thevenot was issued in
1663; but this has been described elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
The collection usually cited as Dapper’s was
printed at Amsterdam, 1669-1729, in folio
(thirteen volumes). It has no collective title,
but among the volumes are two touching
America,&mdash;the <i>Beschrijvinge</i> of Montanus,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and
Nienhof’s <i>Brasiliaansche Zee-en Lantreize</i>.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> A
small collection, <i>Recueil de divers voyages faits
en Africa et en l’Amérique</i>,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> was published
in Paris by Billaine in 1674. It includes
Blome’s Jamaica, Laborde on the Caribs, etc.
Some of the later American voyages were also
printed in the second edition of a Swedish
<i>Reesa-book</i>, printed at Wysingzborg in 1674,
1675.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The Italian collection, <i>Il genio vagante</i>,
was printed at Parma in 1691-1693, in
four volumes.</p>

<p><i>An Account of Several Voyages</i> (London, 1694)
gives Narborough’s to Magellan’s Straits, and
Marten’s to Greenland.</p>

<p>The important English <i>Collection of Voyages
and Travels</i> which passes under the name of
its publisher, Churchill, took its earliest form
in 1704, appearing in four volumes; but was
afterwards increased by two additional volumes
in 1733, and by two more in 1744,&mdash;these last,
sometimes called the <i>Oxford Voyages</i>, being
made up from material in the library of the
Earl of Oxford. It was reissued complete in
1752. It has an introductory discourse by
Caleb Locke; and this, and some other of its
contents, constitutes the <i>Histoire de la navigation</i>,
Paris, 1722.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>John Harris, an English divine, had compiled
a <i>Collection of Voyages</i> in 1702 which was
a rival of Churchill’s, differing from it in being
an historical summary of all voyages, instead
of a collection of some. Harris wrote the Introduction;
but it is questionable how much
else he had to do with it.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> It was revised and
reissued in 1744-1748 by Dr. John Campbell,
and in this form it is often regarded as a supplement
to Churchill.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> It was reprinted in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxv" id="Page_mxxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
volumes, folio, with continuations to date, in
1764.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The well-known Dutch collection (<i>Voyagien</i>)
of Vander Aa was printed at Leyden in 1706,
1707. It gives voyages to all parts of the world
made between 1246 and 1693. He borrows from
Herrera, Acosta, Purchas, De Bry, and all available
sources, and illuminates the whole with
about five hundred maps and plates. In its
original form it made twenty-eight, sometimes
thirty, volumes of small size, in black-letter,
and eight volumes in folio, both editions being
issued at the same time and from the same type.
In this larger form the voyages are arranged by
nations; and it was the unsold copies of this
edition which, with a new general title, constitutes
the edition of 1727. In the smaller form
the arrangement is chronological. In the folio
edition the voyages to Spanish America previous
to 1540 constitute volumes three and four;
while the English voyages, to 1696, are in volumes
five and six.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>In 1707 Du Perier’s <i>Histoire universelle des
voyages</i> had not so wide a scope as its title indicated,
being confined to the early Spanish
voyages to America;<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> the proposed subsequent
volumes not having been printed. An English
translation, under Du Perier’s name, was issued
in London in 1708;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> but when reissued in 1711,
with a different title, it credited the authorship
to the Abbé Bellegarde.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In 1711, also, Captain
John Stevens published in London his <i>New
Collection of Voyages</i>; but Lawson’s Carolina
and Cieza’s Peru were the only American sections.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
In 1715 the French collection known
as Bernard’s <i>Recueil de voiages au Nord</i>, was
begun at Amsterdam. A pretty wide interpretation
is given to the restricted designation of
the title, and voyages to California, Louisiana,
the Upper Mississippi (Hennepin), Virginia,
and Georgia are included.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Daniel Coxe, in
1741, united in one volume <i>A Collection of Voyages</i>,
three of which he had already printed
separately, including Captain James’s to the
Northwest. A single volume of a collection
called <i>The American Traveller</i> appeared in
London in 1743.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The collection known as <i>Astley’s Voyages</i>
was published in London in four volumes in
1745-1747; the editor was John Green, whose
name is sometimes attached to the work. It
gives the travels of Marco Polo, but has nothing
of the early voyages to America,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>&mdash;these
being intended for later volumes, were never
printed. These four volumes were translated,
with some errors and omissions, into French,
and constitute the first nine volumes of the
Abbé Prevost’s <i>Histoire générale des voyages</i>,
begun in Paris in 1746, and completed, in twenty
quarto volumes, in 1789.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> An octavo edition
was printed (1749-1770) in seventy-five volumes.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
It was again reprinted at the Hague in
twenty-five volumes quarto (1747-1780), with
considerable revision, following the original English,
and with Green’s assistance; besides showing
some additions. The Dutch editor was
P. de Hondt, who also issued an edition in Dutch
in twenty-one volumes quarto,&mdash;including, however,
only the first seventeen volumes of his
French edition, thus omitting those chiefly concerning
America.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> A small collection of little
moment, <i>A New Universal Collection of Voyages</i>,
appeared in London in 1755.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> De Brosses’ Histoire

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxvi" id="Page_mxxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Several English collections appeared in the
next few years; among which are <i>The World
Displayed</i> (London, 1759-1761), twenty vols.
16mo,&mdash;of which seven volumes are on American
voyages, compiled from the larger collections,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>&mdash;and
<i>A Curious Collection of Travels</i>
(London, 1761) is in eight volumes, three of
which are devoted to America.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The Abbé de la Porte’s <i>Voyageur François</i>,
in forty-two volumes, 1765-1795 (there are other
dates), may be mentioned to warn the student of
its historical warp with a fictitious woof.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> John
Barrows’ <i>Collection of Voyages</i> (London, 1765), in
three small volumes, was translated into French
by Targe under the title of <i>Abrégé chronologique</i>.
John Callender’s <i>Voyages to the Terra australis</i>
(London, 1766-1788), three volumes, translated
for the first time a number of the narratives in De
Bry, Hulsius, and Thevenot. It gives the voyages
of Vespucius, Magellan, Drake, Galle,
Cavendish, Hawkins, and others.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Dodsley’s
<i>Compendium of Voyages</i> was published in the

Collection of Voyages</i>, generally referred to as
Knox’s, from the publisher’s name, appeared in
seven volumes in 1767, the first three volumes
covering American explorations.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In 1770 Edward

<p>La Harpe issued in Paris, 1780-1801, in
thirty-two volumes,&mdash;Comeyras editing the last
eleven,&mdash;his <i>Abrégé de l’histoire générale des voyages</i>,
which proved a more readable and popular

been later editions and continuations.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Johann Reinhold Forster made a positive
contribution to this field of compilation when
he printed his <i>Geschichte der Entdeckungen und
Schifffahrten im Norden</i> at Frankfort in 1785.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
He goes back to the earliest explorations, and
considers the credibility of the Zeno narrative.
He starts with Gomez for the Spanish section.
A French collection by Berenger, <i>Voyages faits
autour du monde</i> (Paris, 1788-1789), is very scant
on Magellan, Drake, and Cavendish. A collection
was published in London (1789) by Richardson
on the voyages of the Portuguese and
Spaniards during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Mavor’s <i>Voyages, Travels, and Discoveries</i>
(London, 1796-1802), twenty-five volumes,
is a condensed treatment, which passed to
other editions in 1810 and 1813-1815.</p>

<p>A standard compilation appeared in John
Pinkerton’s <i>General Collection of Voyages</i> (London,
1808-1814), in seventeen volumes,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> with over two
hundred maps and plates, repeating the essential
English narratives of earlier collections, and
translating those from foreign languages afresh,
preserving largely the language of the explorers.
Pinkerton, as an editor, was learned, but somewhat
pedantic and over-confident; and a certain
agglutinizing habit indicates a process of amassment
rather than of selection and assimilation.
Volumes xii., xiii., and xiv. are given to America;
but the operations of the Spaniards on the
main, and particularly on the Pacific coast of
North America, are rather scantily chronicled.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>In 1808 was begun, under the supervision of
Malte-Brun and others, the well-known <i>Annales
des voyages</i>, which was continued to 1815, making
twenty-five volumes. A new series, <i>Nouvelles
annales des voyages</i>, was begun in 1819. The
whole work is an important gathering of original
sources and learned comment, and is in considerable
part devoted to America. A French <i>Collection
abrégée des voyages</i>, by Bancarel, appeared
in Paris in 1808-1809, in twelve volumes.</p>

<p><i>The Collection of the best Voyages and Travels</i>,
compiled by Robert Kerr, and published in
Edinburgh in 1811-1824, in eighteen octavo volumes,
is a useful one, though the scheme was
not wholly carried out. It includes an historical
essay on the progress of navigation and discovery
by W. Stevenson. It also includes among
others the Northmen and Zeni voyages, the travels
of Marco Polo and Galvano, the African discoveries
of the Portuguese. The voyages of
Columbus and his successors begin in vol. iii.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mxxxvii" id="Page_mxxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
and the narratives of these voyages are continued
through vol. vi., though those of Drake,
Cavendish, Hawkins, Davis, Magellan, and
others come later in the series.</p>

<p>The <i>Histoire générale des voyages</i>, undertaken
by C. A. Walkenaer in 1826, was stopped in 1831,
after twenty-one octavos had been printed, without
exhausting the African portion.</p>

<p>The early Dutch voyages are commemorated
in Bennet and Wijk’s <i>Nederlandsche Ontdekkingen
in America</i>, etc., which was issued at Utrecht
in 1827,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and in their <i>Nederlandsche Zeereizen</i>,
printed at Dordrecht in 1828-1830, in five volumes
octavo. It contains Linschoten, Hudson, etc.</p>

<p>Albert Montémont’s <i>Bibliothèque universelle
des voyages</i> was published in Paris, 1833-1836, in
forty-six volumes.</p>

<p>G. A. Wimmer’s <i>Die Enthüllung des Erdkreises</i>
(Vienna, 1834), five volumes octavo, is a
general summary, which gives in the last two
volumes the voyages to America and to the
South Seas.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>In 1837 Henri Ternaux-Compans began the
publication of his <i>Voyages, relations, et mémoires
originaux pour servir à l’histoire de la découverte
de l’Amérique</i>, of which an account is given on
another page (see p. vi).</p>

<p>The collection of F. C. Marmocchi, <i>Raccolta
di viaggi dalla scoperta del Nuevo Continente</i>, was
published at Prato in 1840-1843, in five volumes;
it includes the Navarrete collection on Columbus,
Xeres on Pizarro, and other of the Spanish
narratives.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The last volume of a collection in
twelve volumes published in Paris, <i>Nouvelle bibliothèque
des voyages</i>, is also given to America.</p>

<p>The Hakluyt Society in London began its
valuable series of publications in 1847, and has
admirably kept up its work to the present time,
having issued its volumes generally under satisfactory
editing. Its publications are not sold
outside of its membership, except at second
hand.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Under the editing of José Ferrer de Couto
and José March y Labores, and with the royal
patronage, a <i>Historia de la marina real Española</i>
was published in Madrid, in two volumes, 1849
and 1854. It relates the early voyages.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Édouard
Charton’s <i>Voyageurs anciens et modernes</i>
was published in four volumes in Paris, 1855-1857;
and it passed subsequently to a new
edition.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>A summarized account of the Portuguese and
Spanish discoveries, from Prince Henry to
Pizarro, was published in German by Theodor
Vogel, and also in English in 1877.</p>

<p>A <i>Nouvelle histoire des voyages</i>, by Richard
Cortambert, is the latest and most popular presentation
of the subject, opening with the explorations
of Columbus and his successors; and
Édouard Cat’s <i>Les grandes découvertes maritimes
du treizième au seizième siècle</i> (Paris, 1882) is
another popular book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENTS
CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE DISCOVERY OF
AMERICA.</p>

<p class="pc">BY WILLIAM H. TILLINGHAST,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Assistant Librarian of Harvard University.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AS Columbus, in August, 1498, ran into the mouth of the Orinoco, he
little thought that before him lay, silent but irrefutable, the proof of
the futility of his long-cherished hopes. His gratification at the completeness
of his success, in that God had permitted the accomplishment of all
his predictions, to the confusion of those who had opposed and derided
him, never left him; even in the fever which overtook him on the last voyage
his strong faith cried to him, “Why dost thou falter in thy trust in
God? He gave thee India!” In this belief he died. The conviction that
Hayti was Cipangu, that Cuba was Cathay, did not long outlive its author;
the discovery of the Pacific soon made it clear that a new world and another
sea lay between the landfall of Columbus and the goal of his endeavors.</p>

<p>The truth, when revealed and accepted, was a surprise more profound to
the learned than even the error it displaced. The possibility of a short passage
westward to Cathay was important to merchants and adventurers,
startling to courtiers and ecclesiastics, but to men of classical learning it
was only a corroboration of the teaching of the ancients. That a barrier to
such passage should be detected in the very spot where the outskirts of
Asia had been imagined, was unexpected and unwelcome. The treasures
of Mexico and Peru could not satisfy the demand for the products of the
East; Cortes gave himself, in his later years, to the search for a strait which
might yet make good the anticipations of the earlier discoverers. The new
interpretation, if economically disappointing, had yet an interest of its own.
Whence came the human population of the unveiled continent? How had
its existence escaped the wisdom of Greece and Rome? Had it done so?
Clearly, since the whole human race had been renewed through Noah, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
red men of America must have descended from the patriarch; in some way,
at some time, the New World had been discovered and populated from the
Old. Had knowledge of this event lapsed from the minds of men before
their memories were committed to writing, or did reminiscences exist in
ancient literatures, overlooked, or misunderstood by modern ignorance?
Scholars were not wanting, nor has their line since wholly failed, who freely
devoted their ingenuity to the solution of these questions, but with a success
so diverse in its results, that the inquiry is still pertinent, especially
since the pursuit, even though on the main point it end in reservation of
judgment, enables us to understand from what source and by what channels
the inspiration came which held Columbus so steadily to his westward
course.</p>

<p>Although the elder civilizations of Assyria and Egypt boasted a cultivation
of astronomy long anterior to the heroic age of Greece, their cosmographical
ideas appear to have been rude and undeveloped, so that whatever
the Greeks borrowed thence was of small importance compared with what
they themselves ascertained. While it may be doubted if decisive testimony
can be extorted from the earliest Grecian literature, represented
chiefly by the Homeric and Hesiodic poems, it is probable that the people
among whom that literature grew up had not gone, in their conception of
the universe, beyond simple acceptance of the direct evidence of their
senses. The earth they looked upon as a plane, stretching away from the
Ægean Sea, the focus of their knowledge, and ever less distinctly known,
until it ended in an horizon of pure ignorance, girdled by the deep-flowing
current of the river Oceanus. Beyond Oceanus even fancy began to fail:
there was the realm of dust and darkness, the home of the powerless spirits
of the dead; there, too, the hemisphere of heaven joined its brother hemisphere
of Tartarus.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> This conception of the earth was not confined to Homeric
times, but remained the common belief throughout the course of
Grecian history, underlying and outlasting many of the speculations of the
philosophers.</p>

<p>That growing intellectual activity which was signalized by a notable development
of trade and colonization in the eighth century, in the seventh
awoke to consciousness in a series of attempts to formulate the conditions
of existence. The philosophy of nature thus originated, wherein the testimony
of nature in her own behalf was little sought or understood, began
with the assumption of a flat earth, variously shaped, and as variously supported.
To whom belongs the honor of first propounding the theory of the
spherical form of the earth cannot be known. It was taught by the Italian
Pythagoreans of the sixth century, and was probably one of the doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of Pythagoras himself, as it was, a little later, of Parmenides, the founder
of the Eleatics.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>In neither case can there be a claim for scientific discovery. The earth
was a sphere because the sphere was the most perfect form; it was at the
centre of the universe because that was the place of honor; it was motionless
because motion was less dignified than rest.</p>

<p>Plato, who was familiar with the doctrines of the Pythagoreans, adopted
their view of the form of the earth, and did much to popularize it among
his countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> To the generation that succeeded him, the sphericity of
the earth was a fact as capable of logical demonstration as a geometrical
theorem. Aristotle, in his treatise “On the Heaven,” after detailing the
views of those philosophers who regarded the earth as flat, drum-shaped, or
cylindrical, gives a formal summary of the grounds which necessitate the
assumption of its sphericity, specifying the tendency of all things to seek
the centre, the unvarying circularity of the earth’s shadow at eclipses of the
moon, and the proportionate change in the altitude of stars resulting from
changes in the observer’s latitude. Aristotle made the doctrine orthodox;
his successors, Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy, constituted it an
inalienable possession of the race. Greece transmitted it to Rome, Rome
impressed it upon barbaric Europe; taught by Pliny, Hyginus, Manilius,
expressed in the works of Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, it passed into the school-books
of the Middle Ages, whence, reinforced by Arabian lore, it has come
down to us.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>That the belief ever became in antiquity or in the Middle Ages widely
spread among the people is improbable; it did not indeed escape opposition
among the educated; writers even of the Augustan age sometimes
appear in doubt.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The sphericity of the earth once comprehended, there follow certain
corollaries which the Greeks were not slow to perceive. Plato, indeed,
who likened the earth to a ball covered with party-colored strips of leather,
gives no estimate of its size, although the description of the world in the
<i>Phaedo</i> seems to imply immense magnitude;<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> but Aristotle states that
mathematicians of his day estimated the circumference at 400,000 stadia,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
and Archimedes puts the common reckoning at somewhat less than 300,000
stadia.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> How these figures were obtained we are not informed. The first
measurement of the earth which rests on a known method was that made
about the middle of the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, by Eratosthenes, the librarian
at Alexandria, who, by comparing the estimated linear distance between
Syene, under the tropic, and Alexandria with their angular distance, as
deduced from observations on the shadow of the gnomon at Alexandria,
concluded that the circumference of the earth was 250,000 or 252,000
stadia.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> This result, owing to an uncertainty as to the exact length of the
stade used in the computation, cannot be interpreted with confidence,
but if we assume that it was in truth about twelve per cent. too large, we
shall probably not be far out of the way.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Hipparchus, in many matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the opponent of Eratosthenes, adopted his conclusion on this point, and
was followed by Strabo,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> by Pliny, who regarded the attempt as somewhat
over-bold, but so cleverly argued that it could not be disregarded,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and by
many others.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as it resulted, this overestimate was not allowed to stand
uncontested. Posidonius of Rhodes (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 135-51), by an independent
calculation based upon the difference in altitude of Canopus at Rhodes
and at Alexandria, reached a result which is reported by Cleomedes as
240,000, and by Strabo as 180,000 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The final judgment of Posidonius
apparently approved the smaller number; it hit, at all events, the
fancy of the time, and was adopted by Marinus of Tyre and by Ptolemy,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
whose authority imposed it upon the Middle Ages. Accepting it as an
independent estimate, it follows that Posidonius allowed but 500 stadia to
a degree, instead of 700, thus representing the earth as about 28 per cent.
smaller than did Eratosthenes.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>To the earliest writers the known lands constituted the earth; they were
girdled, indeed, by the river Oceanus, but that was a narrow stream whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>further bank lay in fable-land.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The promulgation of the theory of the
sphericity of the earth and the approximate determination of its size drew
attention afresh to the problem of the distribution of land and water upon
its surface, and materially modified the earlier conception. The increase
of geographical knowledge along lines of trade, conquest, and colonization
had greatly extended the bounds of the known world since Homer’s day,
but it was still evident that by far the larger portion of the earth, taking
the smallest estimate of its size, was still undiscovered,&mdash;a fair field for
speculation and fantasy.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>We can trace two schools of thought in respect to the configuration
of this unknown region, both represented in the primitive conception of
the earth, and both conditioned by a more fundamental postulate. It was
a near thought, if the earth was a sphere, to transfer to it the systems of
circles which had already been applied to the heavens. The suggestion
is attributed to Thales, to Pythagoras, and to Parmenides; and it is certain
that the earth was very early conceived as divided by the polar and
solstitial circles into five zones, whereof two only, the temperate in either
sphere, so the Greeks believed, were capable of supporting life; of the
others, the polar were uninhabitable from intense cold, as was the torrid
from its parching heat. This theory, which excluded from knowledge
the whole southern hemisphere and a large portion of the northern, was
approved by Aristotle and the Homeric school of geographers, and by
the minor physicists. As knowledge grew, its truth was doubted. Polybius
wrote a monograph, maintaining that the middle portion of the torrid zone
had a temperate climate, and his view was adopted by Posidonius and
Geminus, if not by Eratosthenes. Marinus and Ptolemy, who knew that
commerce was carried on along the east coast of Africa far below the
equator, cannot have fallen into the ancient error, but the error long
persisted; it was always in favor with the compilers, and thus perhaps
obtained that currency in Rome which enabled it to exert a restrictive and
pernicious check upon maritime endeavor deep into the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the question of the distribution of land and water, unanimity no
longer prevailed. By some it was maintained that there was one ocean,
confluent over the whole globe, so that the body of known lands, that
so-called continent, was in truth an island, and whatever other inhabitable
regions might exist were in like manner surrounded and so separated by
vast expanses of untraversed waves. Such was the view, scarcely more
than a survival of the ocean-river of the poets deprived of its further
bank by the assumption of the sphericity of the earth, held by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
Crates of Mallus, Strabo, Pliny, and many others. If this be called the
oceanic theory, we may speak of its opposite as the continental: according
to this view, the existing land so far exceeded the water in extent that it
formed in truth the continent, holding the seas quite separate within its
hollows. The origin of the theory is obscure, even though we recall
that Homer’s ocean was itself contained. It was strikingly presented by
Plato in the <i>Phaedo</i>, and is implied in the Atlantis myth; it may be recalled,
too, that Herodotus, often depicted as a monster of credulity, had
broken the bondage of the ocean-river, because he could not satisfy himself
of the existence of the ocean in the east or north; and while reluctantly
admitting that Africa was surrounded by water, considered Gaul to extend
indefinitely westward.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Hipparchus revived the doctrine, teaching
that Africa divided the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic in the south, so
that these seas lay in separate basins. The existence of an equatorial
branch of the ocean, a favorite dogma of the other school, was also denied
by Polybius, Posidonius, and Geminus.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>The reports of traders and explorers led Marinus to a like conclusion;
both he and Ptolemy, misinterpreting their information, believed that the
eastern coast of Asia ran south instead of north, and they united it with
the eastern trend of Africa, supposing at the same time that the two
continents met also in the west.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The continental theory, despite its
famous disciples, made no headway at Rome, and was consequently hardly
known to the Middle Ages before its falsity was proved by the circumnavigation
of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>That portion of Europe, Asia, and Africa known to the ancients,
whether regarded as an island, or as separated from the rest of the world
by climatic conditions merely, or by ignorance, formed a distinct concept
and was known by a particular name, <i>ἡ οἰκουμένη</i>. Originally supposed to
be circular, it was later thought to be oblong and as having a length
more than double its width. Those who believed in its insularity likened
its shape to a sling, or to an outspread chlamys or military cloak, and
assumed that it lay wholly within the northern hemisphere. In absolute
figures, the length of the known world was placed by Eratosthenes at
77,800 stadia, and by Strabo at 70,000. The latter figure remained the
common estimate until Marinus of Tyre, in the second century a.d.,
receiving direct information from the silk-traders of a caravan route to
China, substituted the portentous exaggeration of 90,000 stadia on the
parallel of Rhodes, or 225°. Ptolemy, who followed Marinus in many
things, shrank from the naïveté whereby the Tyrian had interpreted a seven
months’ caravan journey to represent seven months’ travelling in a direct
line at the rate of twenty miles a day, and cut down his figures to 180°, or
72,000 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> It appears, therefore, that Strabo considered the known
world as occupying not much over one third of the circuit of the temperate
zone, while Marinus, who adopted 180,000 stadia as the measure of the
earth, claimed a knowledge of two thirds of that zone, and supposed that
land extended indefinitely eastward beyond the limit of knowledge.</p>

<p>What did the ancients picture to themselves of this unknown portion
of the globe? The more imaginative found there a home for ancient myth
and modern fable; the geographers, severely practical, excluded it from
the scope of their survey; philosophers and physicists could easily supply
from theory what they did not know as fact. Pythagoras, it is said, had
taught that the whole surface of the earth was inhabited. Aristotle demonstrated
that the southern hemisphere must have its temperate zone,
where winds similar to our own prevailed; his successors elaborated the

<p>This system was furthest developed by the oceanic school. The rival of
Eratosthenes, Crates of Mallus (who achieved fame by the construction of a
large globe), assumed the existence of a southern continent, separated from
the known world by the equatorial ocean; it is possible that he introduced
the idea of providing a distinct residence for each class of earth-dwellers, by
postulating four island continents, one in each quarter of the globe. Eratosthenes
probably thought that there were inhabitable regions in the southern
hemisphere, and Strabo added that there might be two, or even more, habitable
earths in the northern temperate zone, especially near the parallel of
Rhodes.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Crates introduced his views at Rome, and the oceanic theory
remained a favorite with the Roman physicists. It was avowed by Pliny,
who championed the existence of antipodes against the vulgar disbelief. In
the fine episode in the last book of Cicero’s <i>Republic</i>, the younger Scipio
relates a dream, wherein the elder hero of his name, Scipio Africanus, conveying
him to the lofty heights of the Milky Way, emphasized the futility
of fame by showing him upon the earth the regions to which his name could
never penetrate: “Thou seest in what few places the earth is inhabited, and
those how scant; great deserts lie between them, and they who dwell upon
the earth are not only so scattered that naught can spread from one community
to another, but so that some live off in an oblique direction from
you, some off toward the side, and some even dwell directly opposite to
you.”<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Mela confines himself to a mention of the <i>Antichthones</i>, who live
in the temperate zone in the south, and are cut off from us by the intervening
torrid zone.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, the southern continent, the other world, as it was called,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> made a
more distinct impression than the possible other continents in the northern
hemisphere. Hipparchus thought that Trapobene might be a part of this
southern world, and the idea that the Nile had its source there was widespread:
some supposing that it flowed beneath the equatorial ocean; others
believing, with Ptolemy, that Africa was connected with the southern continent.
The latter doctrine was shattered by the discovery of the Cape of
Good Hope; but the continent was revived when Tierra del Fuego, Australia,
and New Zealand were discovered, and attained gigantic size on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>

<p>The expanding horizon of the
Greeks was always hedged with
fable: in the north was the
realm of the happy Hyperboreans,
beyond the blasts of Boreas;
in the east, the wonderland
of India; in the south, Panchæa
and the blameless Ethiopians;
nor did the west lack
lingering places for romance.
Here was the floating isle of
Æolus, brazen-walled; here the
mysterious Ogygia, navel of the
sea;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and on the earth’s extremest

death, “where life is easiest to man. No snow is there, nor yet great storm
nor any rain, but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill west to
blow cool on men.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Across the ocean river, where was the setting of the

<p class="pp6q p1">“Them on earth’s utmost verge the god assign’d<br />
A life, a seat, distinct from human kind:<br />
Beside the deepening whirlpools of the main,<br />
In those blest isles where Saturn holds his reign,<br />
Apart from heaven’s immortals calm they share<br />
A rest unsullied by the clouds of care:<br />

<p class="p1">“Those who have had the courage to remain stedfast thrice in each life,
and to keep their souls altogether from wrong,” sang Pindar, “pursue the
road of Zeus to the castle of Cronos, where o’er the isles of the blest
ocean breezes blow, and flowers gleam with gold, some from the land on
glistering trees, while others the water feeds; and with bracelets of these
they entwine their hands and make crowns for their heads.”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The Islands of the Blest, <i>μακάρων νῆσοι</i>, do not vanish henceforward from
the world’s literature, but continue to haunt the Atlantic through the Roman
period and deep into the Middle Ages. In the west, too, were localized
other and wilder myths; here were the scenes of the Perseus fable, the
island of the weird and communistic sisters, the Graeae, and the Gorgonides,
the homes of Medusa and her sister Gorgons, the birthplace of the
dread Chimaera.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The importance of the far west in the myths connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with Hercules is well known. In the traditionary twelve labors the Greek
hero is confused with his prototype the Tyrian Melkarth, and those labors
which deal with the west were doubtless borrowed from the cult which
the Greeks had found established at Gades when trade first led them
thither. In the tenth labor it is the western isle Erytheia, which Hercules
visits in the golden cup wherein Helios was wont to make his nocturnal
ocean voyage, and from which he returns with the oxen of the giant
Geryon. Even more famous was the search for the apples of the Hesperides,
which constituted the eleventh labor. This golden fruit, the wedding
gift produced by Gaa for Hera, the prudent goddess, doubtful of the
security of Olympus, gave in charge to the Hesperian maids, whose island
garden lay at earth’s furthest bounds, near where the mysterious Atlas,
their father or their uncle, wise in the secrets of the sea, watched over the
pillars which propped the sky, or himself bore the burden of the heavenly
vault. The poets delighted to depict these isles with their shrill-singing
nymphs, in the same glowing words which they applied to the Isles of the
Blessed. “Oh that I, like a bird, might fly from care over the Adriatic
waves!” cries the chorus in the Crowned Hippolytus,</p>

<p class="ppi6q p1">“Or to the famed Hesperian plains,<br />
Whose rich trees bloom with gold,</p>

<p class="pp6">Beyond whose shores no passage gave<br />

<p class="ppi6q p1">“But Atlas stands, his stately height<br />

<p class="p1">When these names first became attached to some of the Atlantic islands
is uncertain. Diodorus Siculus does not apply either term to the island
discovered by the Carthaginians, and described by him in phrases applicable
to both. The two islands described by sailors to Sertorius about 80
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> were depicted in colors which reminded Plutarch of the Isles of the
Blessed, and it is certain that toward the close of the republic the name
<i>Insulae Fortunatae</i> was given to certain of the Atlantic islands, including the
Canaries. In the time of Juba, king of Numidia, we seem to distinguish
at least three groups, the <i>Insulae Fortunatae</i>, the <i>Purpurariae</i>, and the
<i>Hesperides</i>, but beyond the fact that the first name still designated some of
the Canaries identification is uncertain; some have thought that different
groups among the Canaries were known by separate names, while others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
hold that one or both of the Madeira and Cape de Verde groups were
known.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The Canaries were soon lost out of knowledge again, but the

<p>Beside these ancient, widespread, popular myths, embodying the universal
longing for a happier life, we find a group of stories of more recent
date, of known authorship and well-marked literary origin, which treat of
western islands and a western continent. The group comprises, it is hardly
necessary to say, the tale of Atlantis, related by Plato; the fable of the
land of the Meropes, by Theopompus; and the description of the Saturnian
continent attributed to Plutarch.</p>

<p>The story of Atlantis, by its own interest and the skill of its author, has
made by far the deepest impression. Plato, having given in the <i>Republic</i>
a picture of the ideal political organization, the state, sketched in the <i>Timaeus</i>
the history of creation, and the origin and development of mankind;
in the <i>Critias</i> he apparently intended to exhibit the action of two types
of political bodies involved in a life-and-death contest. The latter dialogue
was unfinished, but its purport had been sketched in the opening of the
<i>Timaeus</i>. Critias there relates “a strange tale, but certainly true, as Solon
declared,” which had come down in his family from his ancestor Dropidas,
a near relative of Solon. When Solon was in Egypt he fell into talk with
an aged priest of Saïs, who said to him: “Solon, Solon, you Greeks are
all children,&mdash;there is not an old man in Greece. You have no old traditions,
and know of but one deluge, whereas there have been many destructions
of mankind, both by flood and fire; Egypt alone has escaped them,
and in Egypt alone is ancient history recorded; you are ignorant of your
own past.” For long before Deucalion, nine thousand years ago, there was
an Athens founded, like Saïs, by Athena; a city rich in power and wisdom,
famed for mighty deeds, the greatest of which was this. At that time there
lay opposite the columns of Hercules, in the Atlantic, which was then navigable,
an island larger than Libya and Asia together, from which sailors
could pass to other islands, and so to the continent. The sea in front of the
straits is indeed but a small harbor; that which lay beyond the island, however,
is worthy of the name, and the land which surrounds that greater sea
may be truly called the continent. In this island of Atlantis had grown
up a mighty power, whose kings were descended from Poseidon, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
extended their sway over many islands and over a portion of the great continent;
even Libya up to the gates of Egypt, and Europe as far as Tyrrhenia,
submitted to their sway. Ever harder they pressed upon the other
nations of the known world, seeking the subjugation of the whole. “Then,
O Solon, did the strength of your republic become clear to all men, by
reason of her courage and force. Foremost in the arts of war, she met the
invader at the head of Greece; abandoned by her allies, she triumphed
alone over the western foe, delivering from the yoke all the nations within
the columns. But afterwards came a day and night of great floods and
earthquakes; the earth engulfed all the Athenians who were capable of
bearing arms, and Atlantis disappeared, swallowed by the waves: hence it is
that this sea is no longer navigable, from the vast mud-shoals formed by the
vanished island.” This tale so impressed Solon that he meditated an epic
on the subject, but on his return, stress of public business prevented his
design. In the <i>Critias</i> the empire and chief city of Atlantis is described
with wealth of detail, and the descent of the royal family from Atlas, son
of Poseidon, and a nymph of the island, is set forth. In the midst of a
council upon Olympus, where Zeus, in true epic style, was revealing to the
gods his designs concerning the approaching war, the dialogue breaks off.</p>

<p>Such is the tale of Atlantis. Read in Plato, the nature and meaning of
the narrative seem clear, but the commentators, ancient and modern, have
made wild work. The voyage of Odysseus has grown marvellously in
extent since he abandoned the sea; Io has found the pens of the learned
more potent goads than Hera’s gadfly; but the travels of Atlantis have
been even more extraordinary. No region has been so remote, no land so
opposed by location, extent, or history to the words of Plato, but that some
acute investigator has found in it the origin of the lost island. It has
been identified with Africa, with Spitzbergen, with Palestine. The learned
Latreille convinced himself that Persia best fulfilled the conditions of the
problem; the more than learned Rudbeck ardently supported the claims of
Sweden through three folios. In such a search America could not be
overlooked. Gomara, Guillaume de Postel, Wytfliet, are among those who
have believed that this continent was Atlantis; Sanson in 1669, and Vaugondy
in 1762, ventured to issue a map, upon which the division of that
island among the sons of Neptune was applied to America, and the outskirts
of the lost continent were extended even to New Zealand. Such work, of
course, needs no serious consideration. Plato is our authority, and Plato declares
that Atlantis lay not far west from Spain, and that it disappeared some
8,000 years before his day. An inquiry into the truth or meaning of the
record as it stands is quite justifiable, and has been several times undertaken,
with divergent results. Some, notably Paul Gaffarel<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and Ignatius
Donnelly,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> are convinced that Plato merely adapted to his purposes a story
which Solon had actually brought from Egypt, and which was in all essentials
true. Corroboration of the existence of such an island in the Atlantic
is found, according to these writers, in the physical conformation of the
Atlantic basin, and in marked resemblances between the flora, fauna,
civilization, and language of the old and new worlds, which demand for their
explanation the prehistoric existence of just such a bridge as Atlantis would
have supplied. The Atlantic islands are the loftiest peaks and plateaus of
the submerged island. In the widely spread deluge myths Mr. Donnelly
finds strong confirmation of the final cataclysm; he places in Atlantis that
primitive culture which M. Bailly sought in the highlands of Asia, and
President Warren refers to the north pole. Space fails for a proper examination
of the matter, but these ingenious arguments remain somewhat top-heavy
when all is said. The argument from ethnological resemblances is
of all arguments the weakest in the hands of advocates. It is of value only
when wielded by men of judicial temperament, who can weigh difference
against likeness, and allow for the narrow range of nature’s moulds. The
existence of the ocean plateaus revealed by the soundings of the “Dolphin”
and the “Challenger” proves nothing as to their having been once raised
above the waves; the most of the Atlantic islands are sharply cut off from
them. Even granting the prehistoric migration of plants and animals between
America and Europe, as we grant it between America and Asia, it
does not follow that it took place across the mid-ocean, and it would still
be a long step from the botanic “bridge” and elevated “ridge” to the
island empire of Plato. In short, the conservative view advocated by Longinus,
that the story was designed by Plato as a literary ornament and a
philosophic illustration, is no less probable to-day than when it was suggested
in the schools of Alexandria. Atlantis is a literary myth, belonging
with <i>Utopia</i>, the <i>New Atlantis</i>, and the <i>Orbis alter et idem</i> of Bishop Hall.</p>

<p class="p2">Of the same type is a narrative which has come down indirectly, among
the flotsam and jetsam of classic literature: it is a fragment from a lost
work by Theopompus of Chios, a historian of the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, found
in the <i>Varia Historia</i> of Aelian, a compiler of the third century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The
story is told by the satyr Silenus to Midas, king of Phrygia, and is, as few
commentators have refrained from remarking, worthy the ears of its auditor.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
“Selenus tolde Midas of certaine Islands, named Europa, Asia, and
Libia, which the Ocean Sea circumscribeth and compasseth round about.
And that without this worlde there is a continent or percell of dry lande,
which in greatnesse (as hee reported) was infinite and unmeasurable, that it
nourished and maintained, by the benifite of the greene medowes and pasture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
plots, sundrye bigge and mighty beastes; that the men which inhabite
the same climats, exceede the stature of us twise, and yet the length of
there life is not equale to ours.” Many other wonders he related of the
two cities, Machimus, the warlike, and Euseues, the city of peace, and how
the inhabitants of the former once made an attack upon Europe, and came
first upon the Hyperboreans; but learning that they were esteemed the
most holy of the dwellers in that island, they “had them in contempte, detesting
and abhorring them as naughty people, of preposterous properties,
and damnable behauiour, and for that cause interrupted their progresse,
supposing it an enterprise of little worthinesse or rather none at al, to trauaile
into such a countrey.” The concluding passage relating to the strange
country inhabited by the Meropes, from whose name later writers have
called the continent Meropian, bears only indirectly upon the subject, as
characterizing the whole narrative.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Without admitting the harsh judgment of Aelian, who brands Theopompus
as a “coyner of lyes and a forger of fond fables,” it is clear that we are
dealing here with literature, not with history, and that the identification of
the land of the Meropes, or, as Strabo calls it, Meropis, with Atlantis or
with America is arbitrary and valueless.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The same remark applies to the account of the great Saturnian continent
that closes the curious and interesting dialogue “On the Face appearing in
the Orb of the Moon,” attributed to Plutarch, and printed with his <i>Morals</i>:</p>

<p>“‘An isle, Ogygia, lies in Ocean’s arms,’” says the narrator, “about
five days’ sail west from Britain; and before it are three others, of equal
distance from one another, and also from that, bearing northwest, where
the sun sets in summer. In one of these the barbarians feign that Saturn
is detained in prison by Zeus.” The adjacent sea is termed the Saturnian,
and the continent by which the great sea is circularly environed is distant
from Ogygia about five thousand stadia, but from the other islands not so
far. A bay of this continent, in the latitude of the Caspian Sea, is inhabited
by Greeks. These, who had been visited by Heracles, and revived
by his followers, esteemed themselves inhabitants of the firm land, calling
all others islanders, as dwelling in land encompassed by the sea. Every
thirty years these people send forth certain of their number, who minister to
the imprisoned Saturn for thirty years. One of the men thus sent forth, at
the end of his service, paid a visit to the great island, as they called Europe.
From him the narrator learned many things about the state of men after
death, which he unfolds at length, the conclusion being that the souls of
men ultimately arrive at the moon, wherein lie the Elysian Fields of Homer.
“And you, O Lamprias,” he adds, “may take my relation in such
part as you please.” After which hint there is, I think, but little doubt as
to the way in which it should be taken by us.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>That Plato, Theopompus, and Plutarch, covering a range of nearly five
centuries, should each have made use of the conception of a continent beyond
the Atlantic, is noteworthy; but it is more naturally accounted for by
supposing that all three had in mind the continental hypothesis of land distribution,
than by assuming for them an acquaintance with the great western
island, America. From this point of view, the result of our search into
the geographical knowledge and mythical tales of the ancients is purely
negative. We find, indeed, well-developed theories of physical geography,
one of which accords remarkably well with the truth; but we also find that
these theories rest solely on logical deductions from the mathematical doctrine
of the sphere, and on an aesthetic satisfaction with symmetry and
analogy. This conclusion could be invalidated were it shown that exploration
had already revealed the secrets of the west, and we must now consider
this branch of the subject.</p>

<p>The history of maritime discovery begins among the Phœnicians. The
civilization of Egypt, as self-centred as that of China, accepted only
the commerce that was brought to its gates; but the men of Sidon and
Tyre, with their keen devotion to material interests, their almost modern
ingenuity, had early appropriated the carrying trade of the east and the
west. As they looked adventurously seaward from their narrow domain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the dim outline of Cyprus beckoned them down a long lane of island stations
to the rich shores of Spain. Even their religion betrayed their bent:
El and Cronos, their oldest deities, were wanderers, and vanished in the
west; on their traces Melkarth led a motley swarm of colonists to the Atlantic.
These legends, filtering through Cyprus, Crete, or Rhodes, or borne
by rash adventurers from distant Gades, appeared anew in Grecian mythology,
the deeds of Melkarth mingling with the labors of Hercules. We do
not know when the Phœnicians first reached the Atlantic, nor what were
the limits of their ocean voyages. Gades, the present Cadiz, just outside
the Straits of Gibraltar, was founded a few years before 1100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but not,
it is probable, without previous knowledge of the commercial importance
of the location. There were numerous other settlements along the adjacent
coast, and the gold, silver, and tin of these distant regions grew familiar in
the markets of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India. The trade with Tartessus,
the El Dorado of antiquity, gave the Phœnician merchant vessels a name
among the Jews, as well in the tenth century, when Solomon shared the
adventures of Hiram, as in the sixth, when Ezekiel depicted the glories of
Tyrian commerce. The Phœnician seamanship was wide-famed; their vessels
were unmatched in speed,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and their furniture and discipline excited
the outspoken admiration of Xenophon. Beside the large Tarshish ships,
they possessed light merchant vessels and ships of war, provided with both
sails and oars, and these, somewhat akin to steamships in their independence
of wind, were well adapted for exploration. Thus urged and thus
provided, it is improbable that the Phœnicians shunned the great ocean.
The evidence is still strong in favor of their direct trade with Britain for
tin, despite what has been urged as to tin mines in Spain and the prehistoric
existence of the trade by land across Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Whether the Tyrians discovered any of the Atlantic islands is unknown;
the adventures and discoveries attributed to Hercules, who in this aspect
is but Melkarth in Grecian raiment, points toward an early knowledge of
western islands, but these myths alone are not conclusive proof. Diodorus
Siculus attributes to the Phœnicians the discovery, by accident, of a large
island, with navigable rivers and a delightful climate, many days’ sail westward
from Africa. In the compilation <i>De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus</i>,
printed with the works of Aristotle, the discovery is attributed to Carthaginians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Both versions descend from one original, now lost, and it is impossible
to give a date to the event, or to identify the locality.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Those who
find America in the island of Diodorus make improbabilities supply the
lack of evidence. Stories seldom lose in the telling, and while it is not
impossible that a Phœnician ship might have reached America, and even
made her way back, it is not likely that the voyage would have been tamely
described as of many <i>days’</i> duration.</p>

<p>When Carthage succeeded Tyre as mistress of the Mediterranean commerce,
interest in the West revived. In the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
two expeditions of importance were dispatched into these waters. A large
fleet under Hanno sailed to colonize, or re-colonize, the western coast of
Africa, and succeeded in reaching the latitude of Sierra Leone. Himilko,
voyaging in the opposite direction, spent several months in exploring the
ocean and tracing the western shores of Europe. He appears to have
run into the Sargasso Sea, but beyond this little is known of his adventures.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Ultimately the Carthaginians discovered and colonized the Canary
Islands, and perhaps the Madeira and Cape Verde groups; the evidence of
ethnology, the presence of Semitic inscriptions, and the occurrence in the
descriptions of Pliny, Mela, and Ptolemy of some of the modern names of
the separate islands, establishes this beyond a doubt for the Canaries.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
There is no evidence that the Phœnicians or Carthaginians penetrated
much beyond the coast islands, or that they reached any part of America,
or even the Azores.</p>

<p>The achievements of the Greeks and Romans were still more limited.
A certain Colaeus visited Gades towards the middle of the seventh century
B.C., and was, according to Herodotus, the first Greek who passed outside
of the columns of Hercules. His example could not have been widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
followed, for we find Pindar and his successors referring to the Pillars as
the limit of navigation. In 600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Massilia was founded, and soon
became a rival of Carthage in the western Mediterranean. In the fourth
century we have evidence of an attempt to search out the secrets of the
ocean after the manner of Hanno and Himilko. In that century, Pytheas
made his famous voyage to the lands of tin and amber, discovering the
still mysterious Thule; while at the same time his countryman Euthymenes
sailed southward to the Senegal. With these exceptions we hear
of no Grecian or Roman explorations in the Atlantic, and meet with no
indication that they were aware of any other lands beyond the sea than
the Fortunate Isles or the Hesperides of the early poets.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>About 80 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Sertorius, being for a time driven from Spain by the
forces of Sulla, fell in, when on an expedition to Baetica, with certain
sailors who had just returned from the “Atlantic islands,” which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
described as two in number, distant 10,000 stadia from Africa, and enjoying
a wonderful climate. The account in Plutarch is quite consistent with
a previous knowledge of the islands, even on the part of Sertorius. Be
this as it may, the glowing praises of the eye-witnesses so impressed him
that only the unwillingness of his followers prevented his taking refuge
there. Within the next few years, the Canaries, at least, became well
known as the <i>Fortunatae Insulae</i>; but when Horace, in the dark days of
civil war, urged his countrymen to seek a new home across the waves, it
was apparently the islands of Sertorius that he had in mind, regarding
them as unknown to other peoples.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>As we trace the increasing volume and extent of commerce from the
days of Tyre and Carthage and Alexandria to its fullest development under
the empire, and remember that as the drafts of luxury-loving Rome upon
the products of the east, even of China and farther India, increased, the
true knowledge of the form of the earth, and the underestimate of the
breadth of the western ocean, became more widely known, the question
inevitably suggests itself, Why did not the enterprise which had long since
utilized the monsoons of the Indian Ocean for direct passage to and from
India essay the passage of the Atlantic? The inquiry gains force as we recall
that the possibility of such a route to India had been long ago asserted.
Aristotle suggested, if he did not express it; Eratosthenes stated plainly
that were it not for the extent of the Atlantic it would be possible to sail
from Spain to India along the same parallel;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and Strabo could object
nothing but the chance of there being another island-continent or two in
the way,&mdash;an objection unknown to Columbus. Seneca, the philosopher,
iterating insistence upon the smallness of the earth and the pettiness of its
affairs compared with the higher interests of the soul, exclaims: “The
earth, which you so anxiously divide by fire and sword into kingdoms, is a
point, a mere point, in the universe.... How far is it from the utmost
shores of Spain to those of India? But very few days’ sail with a favoring
wind.”<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Holding these views of the possibility of the voyage, it is improbable
that the size of their ships and the lack of the compass could have long
prevented the ancients from putting them in practice had their interest so
demanded.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Their interest in the matter was, however, purely speculative,
since, under the unity and power of the Roman empire, which succeeded
to and absorbed the commercial supremacy of the Phœnicians, international
competition in trade did not exist, nor were the routes of trade subject to
effective hostile interruption. The two causes, therefore, which worked
powerfully to induce the voyages of Da Gama and Columbus, after the rise
of individual states had given scope to national jealousy and pride, and
after the fall of Constantinople had placed the last natural gateway of the
eastern trade in the hands of Arab infidels, were non-existent under the
older civilization. It is certain, too, that the ancients had a vivid horror of
the western ocean. In the Odyssey, the western Mediterranean even is
full of peril. With knowledge of the ocean, the Greeks received tales of
“Gorgons and Chimeras dire,” and the very poets who sing the beauties
of the Elysian or Hesperian isles dwell on the danger of the surrounding
sea. Beyond Gades, declared Pindar, no man, however brave, could
pass; only a god might voyage those waters. The same idea recurs in
the reports of travellers and the writings of men of science, but here it
is the storms, or more often the lack of wind, the viscid water or vast
shoals, that check and appall the mariner. Aristotle thought that beyond
the columns the sea was shallow and becalmed. Plato utilized the common
idea of the mudbanks and shoal water of the Atlantic in accounting for
the disappearance of Atlantis. Scylax reported the ocean not navigable
beyond Cerne in the south, and Pytheas heard that beyond Thule sea and
air became confounded. Even Tacitus believed that there was a peculiar
resistance in the waters of the northern ocean.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Whether the Greeks owed this dread to the Phœnicians, and whether the
latter shared the feeling, or simulated and encouraged it for the purpose of
concealing their profitable adventures beyond the Straits, is doubtful. In
two cases, at least, it is possible to trace statements of this nature to Punic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sources, and antiquity agreed in giving the Phœnicians credit for discouraging
rivalry by every art.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>To an age averse to investigation for its own sake, ignorant of scientific
curiosity, and unimpelled by economic pressure, tales like these might seem
decisive against an attempt to sail westward to India. Rome could thoroughly
appreciate the imaginative mingling of science and legend which
vivified the famous prophecy of the poet Seneca:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Venient annis saecula seris<br />
Quibus Oceanus vincula rerum<br />
Laxet, et ingens patebit tellus<br />
Tethysque novos deteget orbes<br />
Nec sit terris ultima Thule.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p class="p1">But even were it overlooked that the prophecy suited better the revelation
of an unknown continent, such as the theory of Crates and Cicero
placed between Europe and Asia, than the discovery of the eastern coast of
India, mariners and merchants might be pardoned if they set the deterrent
opinions collected by the elder Seneca above the livelier fancies of his son.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The scanty records of navigation and discovery in the western waters
confirm the conclusions drawn from the visions of the poets and the theories
of the philosophers. No evidence from the classic writers justifies the
assumption that the ancients communicated with America. If they guessed
at the possibility of such a continent, it was only as we to-day imagine an
antarctic continent or an open polar sea. Evidence from ethnological comparisons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is of course admissible, but those who are best fitted to handle
such evidence best know its dangers; hitherto its use has brought little but
discredit to the cause in which it was invoked.</p>

<p class="p2">The geographical doctrines which antiquity bequeathed to the Middle
Ages were briefly these: that the earth was a sphere with a circumference
of 252,000 or 180,000 stadia; that only the temperate zones were inhabitable,
and the northern alone known to be inhabited; that of the southern,
owing to the impassable heats of the torrid zone, it could not be discovered
whether it were inhabited, or whether, indeed, land existed there; and that
of the northern, it was unknown whether the intervention of another continent,
or only the shoals and unknown horrors of the ocean, prevented a
westward passage from Europe to Asia. The legatee preserved, but did
not improve his inheritance. It has been supposed that the early Middle
Ages, under the influence of barbarism and Christianity, ignored the sphericity
of the earth, deliberately returning to the assumption of a plane surface,
either wheel-shaped or rectangular. That knowledge dwindled after
the fall of the empire, that the early church included the learning as well
as the religion of the pagans in its ban, is undeniable; but on this point
truth prevailed. It was preserved by many school-books, in many popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
compilations from classic authors, and was accepted by many ecclesiastics.
St. Augustine did not deny the sphericity of the earth. It was assumed
by Isidor of Seville, and taught by Bede.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The schoolmen buttressed the
doctrine by the authority of Aristotle and the living science which the Arabs
built upon the Almagest. Gerbert, Albert the Great, Roger Bacon, Dante,
were as familiar with the idea of the earth-globe as were Hipparchus and
Ptolemy. The knowledge of it came to Columbus not as an inspiration or
an invention, but by long, unbroken descent from its unknown Grecian, or
pre-Grecian, discoverer.</p>

appeared separately in a German translation (<i>Die Erdkunde bei den Kirchenvätern</i>, Leipzig, 1884). The

</div></div>

<p>As to the distribution of land and water, the oceanic theory of Crates, as
expounded by Macrobius, prevailed in the west, although the existence of
antipodes fell a victim to the union, in the ecclesiastic mind, of the heathen
theory of an impassable torrid zone with the Christian teaching of the descent
of all men from Adam.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The discoveries made by the ancients in the
ocean, of the Canaries and other islands known to them, were speedily forgotten,
while their geographic myths were superseded by a ranker growth.
The Saturnian continent, Meropis, Atlantis, the Fortunate Isles, the Hesperides,
were relegated to the dusty realm of classical learning; but the
Atlantic was not barren of their like. Mediæval maps swarmed with fabulous
islands, and wild stories of adventurous voyages divided the attention
with tales of love and war. Antillia was the largest, and perhaps the most
famous, of these islands; it was situated in longitude 330° east, and near
the latitude of Lisbon, so that Toscanelli regarded it as much facilitating
the plan of Columbus. Well known, too, was Braçir, or Brazil, having its
proper position west and north of Ireland, but often met with elsewhere;
both this island and Antillia afterward gave names to portions of the new
continent.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Antillia, otherwise called the Island of Seven Cities, was discovered and
settled by an archbishop and six bishops of Spain, who fled into the ocean
after the victory of the Moors, in 714, over Roderick; it is even reported
to have been rediscovered in 1447.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Mayda, Danmar, Man Satanaxio, Isla
Verde, and others of these islands, of which but little is known beside the
names, appear for the first time upon the maps of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, but their origin is quite unknown. It might be thought
that they were derived from confused traditions of their classical predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with which they have been identified, but modern folk-lore has
shown that such fancies spring up spontaneously in every community.
To dream of a distant spot where joy is untroubled and rest unbroken by
grief or toil is a natural and inalienable bent of the human mind. Those
happy islands which abound in the romances of the heathen Celts, Mag
Mell, Field of Delight, Flath Inis, Isle of the Heroes, the Avallon of the
Arthur cycle, were but a more exuberant forth-putting of the same soil
that produced the Elysian Fields of Homer or the terrestrial paradise of the
Hebrews. The later growth is not born of the seed of the earlier, though
somewhat affected by alien grafts, as in the case of the famous island of
St. Brandan, where there is a curious commingling of Celtic, Greek, and
Christian traditions. It is dangerous, indeed, to speak of earlier or later
in reference to such myths; one group was written before the others, but
it is quite possible that the earthly paradise of the Celt is as old as those
of the Mediterranean peoples. The idea of a phantom or vanishing island,
too, is very old,&mdash;as old, doubtless, as the fact of fog-banks and
mirage,&mdash;and it is well exemplified in those mysterious visions which enticed
the sailors of Bristol to many a fruitless quest before the discovery of
America, and for centuries tantalized the inhabitants of the Canaries with
hope of discovery. The Atlantic islands were not all isles of the blessed;
there were many Isles of Demons, such as Ramusio places north of Newfoundland,
a name of evil report which afterward attached itself with more
reason to Sable Island and even to the Bermudas:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Kept, as suppos’d by Hel’s infernal dogs;<br />
Our fleet found there most honest courteous hogs.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Not until the revival of classical learning did the continental system of
Ptolemy reach the west; the way, however, had been prepared for it. The
measurement of a degree, executed under the Calif Mamun, seemed to the
Europeans to confirm the smallest estimate of the size of the earth, which
Ptolemy also had adopted,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> while the travels of Marco Polo, revealing the
great island of Japan, exaggerated the popular idea of the extent of the
known world, until the 225° of Marinus seemed more probable than the
180° of Ptolemy. If, however, time brought this shrinkage in the breadth
of the Atlantic, the temptation to navigators was opposed by the belief in
the dangers of the ocean, which shared the persistent life of the dogma
of the impassable torrid zone, and was strongly reinforced by Arab lore.
Their geographers never tire of dilating on the calms and storms, mudbanks
and fogs, and unknown dangers of the “Sea of Darkness.” Nevertheless,
as the turmoil of mediæval life made gentler spirits sigh for peace
in distant homes, while the wild energy of others found the very dangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the sea delightful, there was opened a double source of adventures, both
real and imaginary. Those pillars cut with inscriptions forbidding further
advance westward, which we owe to Moorish fancy, confounding Hercules
and Atlas and Alexander, were transformed into a knightly hero pointing
oceanwards, or became guide-posts to the earthly paradise.</p>

<p>If there be a legendary flavor in the flight of the seven bishops, we
must set down the wanderings of the Magrurin<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> among the African
islands, the futile but bold attempts of the Visconti to circumnavigate Africa,
as real, though without the least footing in a list of claimants for the
discovery of America. The voyages of St. Brandan and St. Malo, again,
are distinctly fabulous, and but other forms of the ancient myth of the
soul-voyages; and the same may be said of the strange tale of Maelduin.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
But what of those other Irish voyages to Irland-it-mikla and Huitramannaland,
of the voyage of Madoc, of the explorations of the Zeni? While
these tales merit close investigation, it is certain that whatever liftings of
the veil there may have been&mdash;that there were any is extremely doubtful&mdash;were
unheralded at the time and soon forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>It was reserved for the demands of commerce to reveal the secrets of
the west. But when the veil was finally removed it was easy for men to
see that it had never been quite opaque. The learned turned naturally to
their new-found classics, and were not slow to find the passages which
seemed prophetic of America. Seneca, Virgil, Horace, Aristotle, and Theopompus,
were soon pressed into the service, and the story of Atlantis
obtained at once a new importance. I have tried to show in this chapter
that these patrons of a revived learning put upon these statements an
interpretation which they will not bear.</p>

<p>The summing up of the whole matter cannot be better given than in the
words applied by a careful Grecian historian to another question in ancient
geography: “In some future time perhaps our pains may lead us to a
knowledge of those countries. But all that has hitherto been written or
reported of them must be considered as mere fable and invention, and not
the fruit of any real search, or genuine information.”<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<h3><a name="c33" id="c33">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE views of the ancient Mediterranean peoples upon geography are preserved
almost solely in the ancient classics. The poems attributed to Homer and Hesiod,
the so-called Orphic hymns, the odes of Pindar, even the dramatic works of Æschylus and
his successors, are sources for the earlier time. The writings of the earlier philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
are lost, and their ideas are to be found in later writers, and in compilations like the Biographies
of Diogenes Laertius (3d cent. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), the <i>De placitis philosophorum</i> attributed to
Plutarch, and the like. Among the works of Plato the <i>Phaedo</i> and <i>Timaeus</i> and the last
book of the <i>Republic</i> bear on the form and arrangement of the earth; the Timaeus and
<i>Critias</i> contain the fable of Atlantis. The first scientific treatises preserved are the <i>De
Caelo</i> and <i>Meteorologica</i> of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> It is needless to speak in detail of the geographical
writers, accounts of whom will be found in any history of Greek and Roman literature.
The minor pieces, such as the <i>Periplus</i> of Hanno, of Scylax of Caryanda, of Dionysius
Periegetes, the Geography of Agatharcides, and others, have been several times collected;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
and so have the minor historians, which may be consulted for Theopompus, Hecataeus,
and the mythologists.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The geographical works of Pytheas (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 350?), of Eratosthenes
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 276-126), of Polybius (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 204-122), of Hipparchus (flor. circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 125), of Posidonius
(1st cent. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), are preserved only in quotations made by later writers; they have,
however, been collected and edited in convenient form.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The most important source of
our knowledge of Greek geography and Greek geographers is of course the great <i>Geography</i>
of Strabo, which a happy fortune preserved to us. The long introduction upon
the nature of geography and the size of the earth and the dimensions of the known world
is of especial interest, both for his own views and for those he criticises.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Strabo lived
about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 60 to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 24.</p>

<p>The works of Marinus of Tyre having perished, the next important geographical work
in Greek is the world-renowned <i>Geography</i> of Ptolemaeus, who wrote in the second half
of the second century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Despite the peculiar merits and history of this work, it is not
so important for our purpose as the work of Strabo, though it exercised infinitely more
influence on the Middle Ages and on early modern geography.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The astronomical writers are also of importance. Eudoxus of Cnidus, said to have first
adduced the change in the altitude of stars accompanying a change of latitude as proof
of the sphericity of the earth, wrote works now known only in the poems of Aratus,
who flourished in the latter half of the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Geminus (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 50),<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and
Cleomedes,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> whose work is famous for having preserved the method by which Eratosthenes
measured the circumference of the earth, were authors of brief popular compilations
of astronomical science. Of vast importance in the history of learning was the
astronomical work of Ptolemy, <i>ἡ μεγάλη σύνταξις τῆς ἀστρονομίας</i>, which was so honored by
the Arabs that it is best known to us as the <i>Almagest</i>, from <i>Tabric al Magisthri</i>, the
title of the Arabic translation which was made in 827. It has been edited and translated
by Halma (Paris, 1813, 1816).</p>

<p>Much is to be learned from the <i>Scholia</i> attached in early times to the works of
Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, the <i>Argonautica</i> of Apollonius Rhodius (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 276-193?), and
to the works of Aristotle, Plato, etc. In some cases these are printed with the works
commented upon; in other cases, the <i>Scholia</i> have been printed separately. The commentary
of Proclus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 412-485) upon the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato is of great importance in
the Atlantis myth.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Much interest attaches to the dialogue entitled <i>On the face appearing in the orb of the
moon</i>, which appears among the <i>Moralia</i> of Plutarch. Really a contribution to the
question of life after death, this work also throws light upon geographical and astronomical
knowledge of its time.</p>

<p>Among the Romans we find much the same succession of sources. The poets, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid, Tibullus, Lucretius, Lucan, Seneca, touch on geographical or astronomical
points and reflect the opinion of their day.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>The first six books of the great encyclopaedia compiled by Pliny the elder (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 23-79)<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
contain an account of the universe and the earth, which is of the greatest value, and was
long exploited by compilers of later times, among the earliest and best of whom was Solinus.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Equally famous with Solinus was the author of a work of more independent character,
Pomponius Mela, who lived in the first century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> His geography, commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
known as <i>De situ orbis</i> from the mediæval title, though the proper name is <i>De chorographia</i>,
is a work of importance and merit. In the Middle Ages it had wonderful popularity.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
Cicero, who contemplated writing a history of geography, touches upon the arrangement
of the earth’s surface several times in his works, as in the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i>, and
notably in the sixth book of the <i>Republic</i>, in the episode known as the “Dream of Scipio.”
The importance of this piece is enhanced by the commentary upon it written by Macrobius
in the fifth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> A peculiar interest attaches to the poems of Avienus, of
the fourth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, in that they give much information about the character attributed
to the Atlantic Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The astronomical poems of Manilius<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and Hyginus were favorites
in early Middle Ages. The astrological character of the work of Manilius made it popular,
but it conveyed also the true doctrine of the form of the earth. The curious work of
Marcianus Capella gave a résumé of science in the first half of the fifth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and
had a like popularity as a school-book and house-book which also helped maintain the
truth.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Such in the main are the ancient writers upon which we must chiefly rely in considering
the present question. In the interpretation of these sources much has been done by the
leading modern writers on the condition of science in ancient times; like Bunbury, Ukert,
Forbiger, St. Martin, and Peschel on geography;<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> like Zeller on philosophy, not to name
many others;<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> and like Lewis and Martin on astronomy;<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> but there is no occasion to go
to much length in the enumeration of this class of books. The reader is referred to
the examination of the literature of special points of the geographical studies of the
ancients to the notes following this Essay.</p>

<p class="p2">Mediæval cosmology and geography await a thorough student; they are imbedded in
the wastes of theological discussions of the Fathers, or hidden in manuscript cosmographies
in libraries of Europe. It should be noted that confusion has arisen from the use
of the word <i>rotundus</i> to express both the sphericity of the earth and the circularity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
known lands, and from the use of <i>terra</i>, or <i>orbis terrae</i>, to denote the inhabited lands, as
well as the globe. It has been pointed out by Ruge (<i>Gesch. d. Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>,
p. 97) that the later Middle Age adopted the circular form of the <i>oekoumene</i> in
consequence of a peculiar theory as to the relation of the land and water masses of the
earth, which were conceived as two intercepting spheres. The <i>oekoumene</i> might easily
be spoken of as a round disk without implying that the whole earth was plane.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> That
the struggle of the Christian faith, at first for existence and then for the proper harvesting
of the fruits of victory, induced its earlier defenders to wage war against the learning
as well as the religion of the pagans; that Christians were inclined to think time taken
from the contemplation of the true faith worse than wasted when given to investigations
into natural phenomena, which might better be accepted for what they professed to be;
and that they often found in Scripture a welcome support for the evidence of the senses,&mdash;cannot
be denied. It was inevitable that St. Chrysostom, Lactantius, Orosius and
Origines rejected or declined to teach the sphericity of the earth. The curious systems
of Cosmas and Aethicus, marked by a return to the crudest conceptions of the universe,
found some favor in Europe. But the truth was not forgotten. The astronomical poems
of Aratus, Hyginus, and Manilius were still read. Solinus and other plunderers of Pliny
were popular, and kept alive the ancient knowledge. The sphericity of the earth was not
denied by St. Augustine; it was maintained by Martianus Capella, and assumed by
Isidor of Seville. Bede<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> taught the whole system of ancient geography; and but little
later, Virgilius, bishop of Saltzburg, was threatened with papal displeasure, not for teaching
the sphericity of the earth, but for upholding the existence of antipodes.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The
canons of Ptolemy were cited in the eleventh century by Hermann Contractus in his <i>De
utilitatibus astrolabii</i>, and in the twelfth by Hugues de Saint Victor in his <i>Eruditio
didascalica</i>. Strabo was not known before Pope Nicholas V., who ordered the first
translation. Not many to-day can illustrate the truth more clearly than the author of
<i>L’Image du Monde</i>, an anonymous poem of the thirteenth century. If two men, he says,
were to start at the same time from a given point and go, the one east, the other west,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Si que andui egaumont alassent<br />
Il convendroit qu’il s’encontrassent<br />

<p class="p1">In general, the mathematical and astronomical treatises were earlier known to the West
than the purely metaphysical works: this was the case in the eleventh and twelfth centuries;
in the thirteenth the schoolmen were familiar with the whole body of Aristotle’s
works. Thus the influence of Aristotle on natural science was early important, either
through Arabian commentators or paraphrasers, or through translations made from the
Arabic, or directly from the Greek.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Jourdain affirms that it was the influence of Aristotle and his interpreters that kept alive
in the Middle Ages the doctrine that India and Spain were not far apart. He also maintains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that the doctrine of the sphericity of the earth was familiar throughout the Middle
Age, and, if anything, more of a favorite than the other view.</p>

<p>The field of the later ecclesiastical and scholastic writers, who kept up the contentions
over the form of the earth and kindred subjects, is too large to be here minutely surveyed.
Such of them as were well known to the geographical students of the centuries next preceding
Columbus have been briefly indicated in another place;<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> and if not completely, yet
with helpful outlining, the whole subject of the mediæval cosmology has been studied by
not a few of the geographical and cartographical students of later days.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> So far as these
studies pertain to the theory of a Lost Atlantis and the fabulous islands of the Atlantic
Ocean, they will be particularly illustrated in the notes which follow this Essay.</p>

<h3><a name="c38" id="c38">NOTES.</a></h3>

<p><b><a name="n38" id="n38">A.</a></b> <span class="smcap">The Form of the Earth.</span>&mdash;It is not easy to demonstrate that the earliest Greeks believed the earth
to be a flat disk, although that is the accepted and probably correct view of their belief. It is possible to
examine but a small part of the earliest literature, and what we have is of uncertain date and dubious origin;
its intent is religious or romantic, not scientific; its form is poetic. It is difficult to interpret it accurately,
since the prevalent ideas of nature must be deduced from imagery, qualifying words and phrases, and seldom
from direct description. The interpreter, doubtful as to the proportion in which he finds mingled fancy and
honest faith, is in constant danger of overreaching himself by excess of ingenuity. In dealing with such a
literature one is peculiarly liable to abuse the always dangerous argument by which want of knowledge is
inferred from lack of mention. Other difficulties beset the use of later philosophic material, much of which is
preserved only in extracts made by antagonists or by compilers, so that we are forced to confront a lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
context and possible misunderstanding or misquotation. The frequent use of the word <i>στρογγύλος</i>, which has
the same ambiguity as our word “round” in common parlance, often leads to uncertainty. A more fruitful
cause of trouble is inherent in the Greek manner of thinking of the world. It is often difficult to know
whether a writer means the planet, or whether he means the agglomeration of known lands which later
writers called <i>ἡ οἰκουμένη</i>. It is not impossible that when writers refer to the earth as encircled by the river
Oceanus, they mean, not the globe, but the known lands, the eastern continent, as we say, what the Romans
sometimes called <i>orbis terrae or orbis terrarum</i>, a term which may mean the “circle of the lands,” not the
“orb of the earth.” At a later time it was a well-known belief that the earth-globe and water-globe were
excentrics, so that a segment of the former projected beyond the surface of the latter in one part, and constituted
the known world.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>I cannot attach much importance to the line of argument with which modern writers since Voss have tried
to prove that the Homeric poems represent the earth flat. That Poseidon, from the mountains of the Solymi,
sees Odesseus on the sea to the west of Greece (<i>Od.</i> v. 282); that Helios could see his cattle in Thrinakia
both as he went toward the heavens and as he turned toward the earth again (<i>Od.</i> xii. 380); that at sunset
“all the ways are darkened;” that the sun and the stars set in and rose from the ocean,&mdash;these and similar
proofs seem to me to have as little weight as attaches to the expressions “ends of the earth,” or to the flowing
of Oceanus around the earth. There are, however, other and better reasons for assuming that the earth in
earliest thought was flat. Such is the most natural assumption from the evidence of sight, and there is
certainly nothing in the older writings inconsistent with such an idea. We know, moreover, that in the time
of Socrates it was yet a matter of debate as to whether the earth was flat or spherical, as it was in the time of
Plutarch.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> We are distinctly told by Aristotle that various forms were attributed to earth by early philosophers,
and the implication is that the spherical theory, whose truth he proceeds to demonstrate, was a new
thought.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> It is very unlikely, except to those who sincerely accept the theory of a primitive race of unequalled
wisdom, that the sphericity of the earth, having been known to Homer, should have been cast aside by the
Ionic philosophers and the Epicureans, and forgotten by educated people five or six centuries later, as it
must have been before the midnight voyage of Helios in his golden cup, and before similar attempts to
account for the return of the sun could have become current. Ignorance of the true shape of the earth is also
indicated by the common view that the sun appeared much larger at rising to the people of India than to the
Grecians, and at setting presented the same phenomenon in Spain.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> As we have seen, the description of
Tartarus in the Theogony of Hesiod, which Fick thinks an interpolation of much later date, likens the earth
to a lid.</p>

<p>The question has always been an open one. Crates of Mallos, Strabo, and other Homer-worshippers of
antiquity, could not deny to the poet any knowledge current in their day, but their reasons for assuming that
he knew the earth to be a globe are not strong. In recent years President Warren has maintained that
Homer’s earth was a sphere with Oceanus flowing around the equator, that the pillars of Atlas meant the axis
of the earth, and that Ogygia was at the north pole.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Homer, however, thought that Oceanus flowed around
the known lands, not that it merely grazed their southern border: it is met with in the east where the sun
rises, in the west (<i>Od.</i> iv. 567), and in the north (<i>Od.</i> v. 275).</p>

<p>That “Homer and all the ancient poets conceived the earth to be a plane” was distinctly asserted by
Geminus in the first century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> and has been in general steadfastly maintained by moderns like Voss,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
Völcker,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Buchholtz,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Gladstone,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Martin,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Schaefer,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and Gruppe.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> It is therefore intrinsically probable,
commonly accepted, and not contradicted by what is known of the literature of the time itself.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n39" id="n39">B.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Homer’s Geography.</span>&mdash;There is an extensive literature on the geographic attainments of Homer, but
it is for the most part rather sad reading. The later Greeks had a local identification for every place mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in the <i>Odyssey</i>; but conservative scholars at present are chary of such, while agreed in confining the
scene of the wanderings to the western Mediterranean. Gladstone, in <i>Homer and the Homeric Age</i>, has
argued with ingenuity for the transfer of the scene from the West to the East, and has constructed on this
basis one of the most extraordinary maps of “the ancient world” known. K. E. von Baer (<i>Wo ist der Schauplatz
d. Fahrten d. Odysseus zu finden? 1875</i>), agreeing with Gladstone, “identifies” the Lastrygonian
harbor with Balaklava, and discovers the very poplar grove of Persephone. It is a favorite scheme with
others to place the wanderings outside the columns of Hercules, among the Atlantic isles,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> and to include a
circumnavigation of Africa. The better opinion seems to me that which leaves the wanderings in the western
Mediterranean, which was considered to extend much farther north than it actually does. The maps which
represent the voyage within the actual coast lines of the sea, and indicate the vessel passing through the
Straits to the ocean, are misleading. There is not enough given in the poem to resolve the problem. The
courses are vague, the distances uncertain or conventional,&mdash;often neither are given; and the matter is complicated
by the introduction of a <i>floating</i> island, and the mysterious voyages from the land of the Phaeacians.
It is a pleasant device adopted by Buchholtz and others to assume that where the course is not given, the
wind last mentioned must be considered to still hold, and surely no one will grudge the commentators this
amelioration of their lot.</p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n40" id="n40">C.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Supposed References to America.</span>&mdash;It is well known that Columbus’s hopes were in part based
on passages in classical authors.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Glareanus, quoting Virgil in 1527, after Columbus’s discovery had
made the question of the ancient knowledge prominent, has been considered the earliest to open the discussion;<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
and after this we find it a common topic in the early general writers on America, like Las Casas (<i>Historia
General</i>), Ramusio (introd. vol. iii.), and Acosta (book i. ch. 11, etc.)</p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was not an uncommon subject of academic and learned discussion.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
It was a part of the survey made by many of the writers who discussed the origin of the American
tribes, like Garcia,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Lafitau,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Samuel Mather,<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Robertson,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> not to name others.</p>

<p>It was not till Humboldt compassed the subject in his <i>Examen Critique de l’histoire de la géographie du
nouveau continent</i> (Paris, 1836), that the field was fully scanned with a critical spirit, acceptable to the
modern mind. He gives two of the five volumes which comprise the work to this part of his subject, and
very little has been added by later research, while his conclusions still remain, on the whole, those of the most
careful of succeeding writers. The French original is not equipped with guides to its contents, such as a
student needs; but this is partly supplied by the index in the German translation.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The impediments which
the student encounters in the <i>Examen Critique</i> are a good deal removed in a book which is on the whole the
easiest guide to the sources of the subject,&mdash;Paul Gaffarel’s <i>Etude sur les rapports de l’Amérique et de
l’ancien continent avant Christophe Colomb</i> (Paris, 1869).<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The literature of the supposed old-world communication with America shows other phases of this question
of ancient knowledge, and may be divided, apart from the Greek embraced in the previous survey, into
those of the Egyptians, Phœnicians, Tyrians, Carthaginians, and Romans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptian theory has been mainly worked out in the present century. Paul Felix Cabrera’s <i>Teatro critico
Americano</i>, printed with Rio’s <i>Palenqué</i> (Lond., 1822), formulates the proofs. An essay by A. Lenoir, comparing
the Central American monuments with those of Egypt, is appended to Dupaix’s <i>Antiquités Méxicaines</i>
(1805). Delafield’s <i>Inquiry into the Origin of the Antiquities of America</i> (Cincinnati, 1839), traces it
to the Cushites of Egypt, and cites Garcia y Cubas, <i>Ensayo de an Estudio Comparativo entre las Pirámides
Egipcias y Méxicanas</i>. Brasseur de Bourbourg discussed the question, <i>S’il existe des sources de l’histoire
primitive du Méxique dans les monuments égyptiens de l’histoire primitive de l’ancien monde dans les
monuments américains?</i> in his ed. of Landa’s <i>Relations des Choses de Yucatan</i> (Paris, 1864). Buckle (<i>Hist.
of Civilization</i>, i. ch. 2) believes the Mexican civilization to have been strictly analogous to that of India and
Egypt. Tylor (<i>Early Hist. of Mankind</i>, 98) compares the Egyptian hieroglyphics with those of the Aztecs.
John T. C. Heaviside, <i>Amer. Antiquities, or the New World the Old, and the Old World the New</i> (London,
1868), maintains the reverse theory of the Egyptians being migrated Americans. F. de Varnhagen
works out his belief in <i>L’origine touranienne des américains tupis-caribes et des anciens égyptiens montrée
principalement par la philologie comparée; et notice d’une émigration en Amérique effectuée à travers
l’Atlantique plusieurs siècles avant notre ère</i> (Vienne 1876).<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle’s mention of an island discovered by the Phœnicians was thought by Gomara and Oviedo to refer to
America. The elder leading writers on the origin of the Indians, like Garcia, Horn, De Laet, and at a later day
Lafitau, discuss the Phœnician theory; as does Voss in his annotations on Pomponius Mela (1658), and Count
de Gebelin in his <i>Monde primitif</i> (Paris, 1781). In the present century the question has been touched by
Cabrera in Rio’s <i>Palenqué</i> (1822). R. A. Wilson, in his <i>New Conquest of Mexico</i>, assigns (ch. v.) the ruins
of Middle America to the Phœnicians. Morlot, in the <i>Actes de la Société Jurassienne d’Emulation</i> (1863),
printed his “La découverte de l’Amérique par les Phènicièns.” Gaffarel sums up the evidences in a paper in
the <i>Compte Rendu, Cong. des Amér.</i> (Nancy), i. 93.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The Tyrian theory has been mainly sustained by a foolish book, by a foolish man, <i>An Original History of
Anc. America</i> (London, 1843), by Geo. Jones, later known as the Count Johannes (cf. Bancroft’s <i>Native
Races</i>, v. 73).</p>

<p>The Carthaginian discovery rests mainly on the statements of Diodorus Siculus.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Baron Zach in his <i>Correspondenz</i> undertakes to say that Roman voyages to America were common in the
days of Seneca, and a good deal of wild speculation has been indulged in.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n41" id="n41">D.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Atlantis.</span>&mdash;The story of Atlantis rests solely upon the authority of Plato, who sketched it in the
<i>Timaeus</i>, and began an elaborated version in the <i>Critias</i> (if that fragment be by him), which old writers often
cite as the <i>Atlanticus</i>. This is frequently forgotten by those who try to establish the truth of the story, who
often write as if all statements in print were equally available as “authorities,” and quote as corroborations
of the tale all mentions of it made by classical writers, regardless of the fact that all are later than Plato, and
can no more than Ignatius Donnelly corroborate him. In fact, the ancients knew no better than we what to
make of the story, and diverse opinions prevailed then as now. Many of these opinions are collected by Proclus
in the first book of his commentary on the <i>Timaeus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and all shades of opinion are represented from
those who, like Crantor, accepted the story as simply historical, to those who regarded it as a mere fable.
Still others, with Proclus himself, accepted it as a record of actual events, while accounting for its introduction
in Plato by a variety of subtile metaphysical interpretations. Proclus reports that Crantor, the first commentator
upon Plato (<i>circa</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 300), asserted that the Egyptian priests said that the story was written on pillars
which were still preserved,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> and he likewise quotes from the <i>Ethiopic History</i> of Marcellus, a writer of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
nothing else is known, a statement that according to certain historians there were seven islands in the external
sea sacred to Proserpine; and also three others of great size, one sacred to Pluto, one to Ammon, and another,
the middle one, a thousand stadia in size, sacred to Neptune. The inhabitants of it preserved the remembrance,
from their ancestors, of the Atlantic island which existed there, and was truly prodigiously great,
which for many periods had dominion over all the islands in the Atlantic sea, and was itself sacred to Neptune.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
Testimony like this is of little value in such a case. What comes to us at third hand is more apt to
need support than give it; yet these two passages are the strongest evidence of knowledge of Atlantis
outside of Plato that is preserved. We do indeed find mention of it elsewhere and earlier. Thus Strabo<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
says that Posidonius (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 135-51) suggested that, as the land was known to have changed in elevation,
Atlantis might not be a fiction, but that such an island-continent might actually have existed and disappeared.
Pliny<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> also mentions Atlantis in treating of changes in the earth’s surface, though he qualifies his quotation
with “si Platoni credimus.”<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> A mention of the story in a similar connection is made by Ammianus
Marcellinus.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>In the Scholia to Plato’s <i>Republic</i> it is said that at the great Panathenaea there was carried in procession a
<i>peplum</i> ornamented with representations of the contest between the giants and the gods, while on the <i>peplum</i>
carried in the little Panathenaea could be seen the war of the Athenians against the Atlantides. Even
Humboldt accepted this as an independent testimony in favor of the antiquity of the story; but Martin has
shown that, apart from the total inconsistency of the report with the expressions of Plato, who places the narration
of this forgotten deed of his countrymen at the celebration of the festival of the little Panathenaea, the
scholiast has only misread Proclus, who states that the <i>peplum</i> depicted the repulse of the barbarians, <i>i. e.</i>
Persians, by the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> To these passages it is customary to add references to the Meropian continent of
Theopompus,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> the Saturnian of Plutarch, the islands of Aristotle, Diodorus and Pausanias,&mdash;which is very
much as if one should refer to the <i>New Atlantis</i> of Bacon as evidence for the existence of More’s <i>Utopia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
Plutarch in his life of Solon attributes Solon’s having given up the idea of an epic upon Atlantis to his advanced
age rather than to want of leisure; but there is nothing to show that he had any evidence beyond Plato that
Solon ever thought of such a poem, and Plato does not say that Solon began the poem, though Plutarch
appears to have so understood him.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Thus it seems more probable that all the references to Atlantis by
ancient writers are derived from the story in Plato than that they are independent and corroborative statements.</p>

<p>With the decline of the Platonic school at Alexandria even the name of Atlantis readily vanished from
literature. It is mentioned by Tertullian,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and found a place in the strange system of Cosmas Indicopleustes,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
but throughout the Middle Ages little or nothing was known of it. That it was not quite forgotten appears
from its mention in the <i>Image du Monde</i>, a poem of the thirteenth century, still in MS., where it is assigned
a location in the <i>Mer Betée</i> (= coagulée).<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Plato was printed in Latin in 1483, 1484, 1491, and in Greek
in 1513, and in 1534 with the commentary of Proclus on the Timaeus.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The <i>Timaeus</i> was printed separately
five times in the sixteenth century, and also in a French and an Italian translation.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>The discovery of America doubtless added to the interest with which the story was perused, and the old
controversy flamed up with new ardor. It was generally assumed that the account given by Plato was not his
invention. Opinions were, however, divided as to whether he had given a correct account. Of those who
believed that he had erred as to the locality or as to the destruction of the island, some thought that America
was the true Atlantis, while others, with whose ideas we have no concern here, placed Atlantis in Africa, Asia,
or Europe, as prejudice led them. Another class of scholars, sensible of the necessity of adhering to the text
of the only extant account, accepted the whole narrative, and endeavored to find in the geography of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Atlantic, or as indicated by the resemblances between the flora, fauna, and civilization of America and of the
old world, additional reasons for believing that such an island had once existed, and had disappeared after
serving as a bridge by which communication between the continents was for a time carried on. The discussion
was prolonged over centuries, and is not yet concluded. The wilder theories have been eliminated by time,
and the contest may now be said to be between those who accept Plato’s tale as true and those who regard it
as an invention. The latter view is at present in favor with the most conservative and careful scholars, but
the other will always find advocates. That Atlantis was America was maintained by Gomara, Guillaume
de Postel, Horn, and others incidentally, and by Birchrod in a special treatise,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> which had some influence even
upon the geographer Cellarius. In 1669 the Sansons published a map showing America divided among the
descendants of Neptune as Atlantis was divided, and even as late as 1762 Vaugondy reproduced it.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> In
his edition of Plato, Stallbaum expressed his belief that the Egyptians might have had some knowledge of
America.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Cluverius thought the story was due to a knowledge of America.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Very lately Hyde Clark has found in the Atlantis fable evidence of a knowledge of America: he does not
believe in the connecting island Atlantis, but he holds that Plato misinterpreted some account of America
which had reached him.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Except for completeness it is scarcely worth mentioning that Blackett, whose work
can really be characterized by no other word than absurd, sees America in Atlantis.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>Here should be mentioned a work by Berlioux, which puts Euhemerus to the blush in the manner in which
history with much detail is extorted from mythology.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> He holds that Atlantis was the northwestern coast of
Africa; that under Ouranos and Atlas, astronomers and kings, it was the seat of a great empire which had
conquered portions of America and kept a lively commercial intercourse with that country.</p>

<p>Ortelius in several places speaks of the belief that America was the old Atlantis, and also attributes that
belief to Mercator.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>That Atlantis might really have existed<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and disappeared, leaving the Atlantic islands as remnants, was too
evident to escape notice. Ortelius suggested that the island of Gades might be a fragment of Atlantis,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and
the doctrine was early a favorite. Kircher, in his very curious work on the subterranean world, devotes
considerable space to Atlantis, rejecting its connection with America, while he maintains its former existence,
and holds that the Azores, Canaries, and other Atlantic islands were formerly parts thereof, and that they
showed traces of volcanic fires in his day.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Las Casas in his history of the Indies devoted an entire chapter to Atlantis, quoting the arguments of
Proclus, in his commentary on Plato, in favor of the story, though he is himself more doubtful. He also
cites confirmative passages from Philo and St. Anselm, etc. He considers the question of the Atlantic isles,
and cites authorities for great and sudden changes in the earth’s surface.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>The same view was taken by Becman,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> and Fortia D’Urban. Turnefort included America in the list of
remnants; and De la Borde followed Sanson in extending Atlantis to the farthest Pacific islands.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Bory
de St. Vincent,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> again, limited Atlantis to the Atlantic, and gave on a map his ideas of its contour.</p>

<p>D’Avezac maintains this theory in his <i>Iles africaines de l’Océan Atlantique</i>,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> p. 5-8. Carli devoted a
large part of the second volume of his <i>Lettere Americane</i> to Atlantis, controverting Baily, who placed Atlantis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in Spitzbergen. Carli goes at considerable length into the topographical and geological arguments in favor of
its existence.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The early naturalists, when the doctrine of great and sudden changes in the earth’s surface
was in favor, were inclined to look with acquiescence on this belief. Even Lyell confessed a temptation to
accept the theory of an Atlantis island in the northern Atlantic, though he could not see in the Atlantic
islands trace of a mid-Atlantic bridge.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> About the middle of this century scholars in several departments of
learning, accepting the evidences of resemblances between the product of the old and new world, were induced
to turn gladly to such a connection as would have been offered by Atlantis; and the results obtained at about
the same time by studies in the pre-Columbian traditions and civilization of Mexico were brought forward as
supporting the same theory. That the Antilles were remnants of Atlantis; that the Toltecs were descendants
from the panic-stricken fugitives of the great catastrophe, whose terrors were recorded in their traditions, as
well as in those of the Egyptians, was ardently urged by Brasseur de Bourbourg.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>In 1859 Retzius announced that he found a close resemblance between the skulls of the Guanches of the
Canaries and the Guaranas of Brazil, and recalled the Atlantis story to explain it.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> In 1846 Forbes declared
his belief in the former existence of a bridge of islands in the North Atlantic, and in 1856 Heer attempted to
show the necessity of a similar connection from the testimony of palæontological botany.</p>

<p>In 1860, Unger deliberately advocated the Atlantis hypothesis to explain the likeness between the fossil
flora of Europe and the living flora of America, enumerating over fifty similar species; and Kuntze found in
the case of the tropical seedless banana, occurring at once in America before 1492 and in Africa, a strong
evidence of the truth of the theory.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>A condensed review of the scientific side of the question is given by A. Boué in his article <i>Ueber die Rolle
der Veränderungen des unorganischen Festen im grossen Massstabe in der Natur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>The deep-sea soundings taken in the Atlantic under the auspices of the governments of the United States,
England, and Germany resulted in discoveries which gave a new impetus to the Atlantis theory. It was
shown that, starting from the Arctic plateau, a ridge runs down the middle of the Atlantic, broadening toward
the Azores, and contracting again as it trends toward the northeast coast of South America. The depth over
the ridge is less than 1,000 fathoms, while the valleys on either side average 3,000; it is known after the U. S.
vessel which took the soundings as the Dolphin ridge. A similar though more uniformly narrow ridge
was found by the “Challenger” expedition (1873-76), extending from somewhat north of Ascension Island
directly south between South America and Africa. It is known as the Challenger ridge. There is, beside,
evidence for the existence of a ridge across the tropical Atlantic, connecting the Dolphin and Challenger
ridges. Madeira, the Canaries, and the Cape Verde Islands are cut off from these ridges by a deep valley,
but are connected by shoals with the continent. Upon the publication of the Challenger chart (<i>Special Report</i>,
vii. 1876), those who favored the theory of communication between the continents were not slow to
appropriate its disclosures in their interests (<i>Nature</i>, Dec. 21, 1876, xv. 158). In March, 1877, W. Stephen
Mitchell delivered a lecture at South Kensington, wherein he placed in juxtaposition the theory of Unger
and the revelations of the deep-sea soundings, when he announced, however, that he did not mean to assert
that these ridges had ever formed a connecting link above water between the continents.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Others were less
cautious,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> but in general this interpretation did not commend itself as strongly to conservative men of science
as it might have done a few years before, because such men were gradually coming to doubt the fact of
changes of great moment in the earth’s surface, even those of great duration.</p>

<p>In 1869, M. Paul Gaffarel published his first treatise on Atlantis,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> advocating the truth of the story, and in
1880 he made it the subject of deeper research, utilizing the facts which ocean exploration had placed at
command.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> This is the best work which has appeared upon this side of the question, and can only be set against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the earlier work by Martin.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The same theory has been supported by D. P. de Novo y Colson, who went so
far as to predict the ultimate recovery of some Atlantean manuscripts from submarine grottoes of some of the
Atlantic islands,&mdash;a hope which surpasses Mr. Donnelly.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Winchell found the theory too useful in his scheme of ethnology to be rejected,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> but it was reserved for
Ignatius Donnelly to undertake the arrangement of the deductions of modern science and the data of old
traditions into a set argument for the truth of Plato’s story. His book,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> in many ways a rather clever statement
of the argument, so evidently presented only the evidence in favor of his view, and that with so little
critical estimate of authorities and weight of evidence, that it attracted only uncomplimentary notice from the
scientific press.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> It was, however, the first long presentation of the case in English, and as such made an impression
on many laymen. In 1882 was also published the second volume of the <i>Challenger Narrative</i>,
containing a report by M. Renard on the geologic character of the mid-Atlantic island known as St. Paul’s
rocks. The other Atlantic islands are confessedly of volcanic origin, and this, which laymen interpreted in
favor of the Atlantis theory, militated with men of science against the view that they were remnants of a
sunken continent. St. Paul’s, however, was, as noted by Darwin, of doubtful character, and Renard came
to the conclusion that it was composed of crystalline schists, and had therefore probably been once overlaid
by masses since removed.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> This conclusion, which tended in favor of Atlantis, was controverted by A. Geikie<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
and by M. E. Wadsworth,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> (the latter having personally inspected specimens,) on the ground that the rocks
were volcanic in origin, and that, had they been schists, the inference of denudation would not follow. Dr.
Guest declared that ethnologists have fully as good cause as the botanists to regard Atlantis as a fact.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> A. J.
Weise in treating of the Discoveries of America adopted the Atlantis fable unhesitatingly, and supposes that
America was known to the Egyptians through that channel.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>That the whole story was invented by Plato as a literary ornament or allegorical argument, or that he thus
utilized a story which he had really received from Egypt, but which was none the less a myth, was maintained
even among the early Platonists, and was the view of Longinus. Even after the discovery of America many
writers recognized the fabulous touch in it, as Acosta,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> who thought, “being well considered, they are rediculous
things, resembling rather to <i>Ovid’s</i> tales then a Historie of Philosophie worthy of accompt,” and “cannot
be held for true but among children and old folkes”&mdash;an opinion adopted by the judicious Cellarius.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Among more recent writers, D’Anville, Bartoli,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Gosselin,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Ukert,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> approved this view.</p>

<p>Humboldt threw the weight of his great influence in favor of the mythical interpretation, though he found
the germ of the story in the older geographic myth of the destruction of Lyctonia in the Mediterranean (Orph.
<i>Argonaut.</i>, 1274, etc.);<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> while Martin, in his work on the <i>Timaeus</i>, with great learning and good sense, reduced
the story to its elements, concluding that such an island had never existed, the tale was not invented by Plato,
but had really descended to him from Solon, who had heard it in Egypt.</p>

<p>Prof. Jowett regards the entire narrative as “due to the imagination of Plato, who could easily invent ‘Egyptians
or anything else,’ and who has used the name of Solon ... and the tradition of the Egyptian priest to give
verisimilitude to his story;”<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> and Bunbury is of the same opinion, regarding the story as “a mere fiction,”
and “no more intended to be taken seriously ... than the tale of Er the Pamphylian.”<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Mr. Archer-Hind, the
editor of the only separate edition of the <i>Timaeus</i> which has appeared in England, thinks it impossible to
determine “whether Plato has invented the story from beginning to end, or whether it really more or less
represents some Egyptian legend brought home by Solon,” which seems to be a fitting conclusion to the
whole matter.</p>

<p>The literature of the subject is widely scattered, but a good deal has been done bibliographically in some
works which have been reserved for special mention here. The earliest is the <i>Dissertation sur l’Atlantide</i>, by
Th. Henri Martin,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> wherein, beside a carefully reasoned examination of the story itself and similar geographic
myths, the opposing views of previous writers are set forth in the second section, <i>Histoire des Systèmes sur
l’Atlantide</i>, pp. 258-280. Gaffarel has in like manner given a résumé of the literature, which comes down
later than that of Martin, in the two excellent treatises which he has devoted to the subject; he is convinced
of the existence of such an island, but his work is marked by such care, orderliness, and fulness of citations
that it is of the greatest value.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The references in these treatises are made with intelligence, and are, in general,
accurate and useful. That this is not the case with the work of Mr. Donnelly deprives the volume of
much of the value which it might have had.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n46" id="n46">E.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Fabulous Islands of the Atlantic in the Middle Ages.</span>&mdash;Fabulous islands belong quite as
much to the domain of folk-lore as to that of geography. The legends about them form a part of the great
mass of superstitions connected with the sea. What has been written about these island myths is for the
most part scattered in innumerable collections of folk-tales and in out-of-the-way sources, and it does not lie
within the scope of the present sketch to track in these directions all that has been said. It will not be out of
place, however, to refer to a few recent works where much information and many references can be found.
One of the fullest collections, though not over-well sorted, is by Lieut. F. S. Bassett,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> consisting of brief notes
made in the course of wide reading, well provided with references, which are, however, often so abbreviated as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to inflict much trouble on those who would consult them,&mdash;an all too common fault. Of interest is a chapter
on <i>Les îles</i>, in a similar work by M. Paul Sebillot.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> An island home has often been assigned to the soul after
death, and many legends, some mediæval, some of great antiquity, deal with such islands, or with voyages
to them. Some account of these will be found in Bassett, and particularly in an article by E. Beauvois in the
<i>Revue de l’histoire de Religion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> where further references are to be found. Wm. F. Warren has also collected
many references to the literature of this subject in the course of his endeavor to show that Paradise was at the
North Pole.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The long articles on <i>Eden</i> and <i>Paradise</i> in McClintock and Strong’s <i>Biblical Encyclopedia</i>
should also be consulted.</p>

<p>In what way the fabulous islands of the Atlantic originated is not known, nor has the subject been exhaustively
investigated. The islands of classical times, in part actual discoveries, in part born of confused
reports of actual discoveries, and in part probably purely mythical, were very generally forgotten as ancient
civilization declined.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The other islands which succeeded them were in part reminiscences of the islands
known to the ancients or invented by them, and in part products of a popular mythology, as old perhaps as
that of the Greeks, but until now unknown to letters. The writers who have dealt with these islands have
treated them generally from the purely geographic point of view. The islands are known principally from
maps, beginning with the fourteenth century, and are not often met with in descriptive works. Formaleoni,
in his attempt to show that the Venetians had discovered the West Indies prior to Columbus, made studies
of the older maps which naturally led him to devote considerable attention to these islands.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>They are also considered by Zurla.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> The first general account of them was given by Humboldt in the
<i>Examen Critique</i>,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> and to what he did little if anything has since been added. D’Avezac<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> treated the subject,
giving a brief sketch of the islands known to the Arab geographers,&mdash;a curious matter which deserves
more attention.</p>

<p>Still more recently Paul Gaffarel has treated the matter briefly, but carefully.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> A study of old maps by H.
Wuttke, in the <i>Jahresbericht des Vereins für Erdkunde zu Dresden</i>,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> gives considerable attention to the
islands; and Theobald Fischer, in his commentary on the collection of maps reproduced by Ongania, has briefly
touched on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> as has Cornelio Desimoni in various papers in the <i>Atti della Società Ligure di Storia
patria</i>, xiv., and other years, in the <i>Atti dell’ Acad. dei Nuova Lincei</i>, in the <i>Gionale ligustico</i>, etc. R. H.
Major’s <i>Henry the Navigator</i> should also be consulted.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Strictly speaking, the term mythical islands ought to include, if not Frisland and Drogeo, at least the land
of Bus, the island of Bimini with its fountain of life, an echo of one of the oldest of folk-tales, the island of
Saxenburg, and the other non-existent islands, shoals, and rocks, with which the imagination of sailors and
cartographers have connected the Atlantic even into the present century. In fact, the name is by common
consent restricted to certain islands which occur constantly on old charts: the Island of St. Brandan, Antillia
or Isle of the Seven Cities, Satanaxio, Danmar, Brazil, Mayda, and Isla Verte. It is interesting to note that
the Arab geographers had their fabulous islands, too, though so little is known of them that it is at present
impossible to say what relation they bear to those mentioned. They say that Ptolemy assigned 25,000 islands
to the Atlantic, but they name and describe seventeen only, among which we may mention the Eternal Islands
(Canaries? Azores?),<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> El-Ghanam (Madeira?), Island of the Two Sorcerers (Lancerote?), etc.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>There has been some difference of opinion as to which of the Atlantic islands answer to the ancient conception
of the Fortunate Islands. It is probable that the idea is at the bottom of several of these, but it may
be doubted whether the island of St. Brandan is not entirely due to the christianizing of this ancient fable.</p>

<p>We proceed now to examine the accounts of some of these islands.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">St. Brandan.</span>&mdash;St. Brandan, or Brendan, who died May 16, 577, was Abbot of Cluainfert, in Ireland,
according to the legend, where he was visited by a friend, Barontus, who told him that far in the ocean
lay an island which was the land promised to the saints. St. Brandan set sail for this island in company
with 75 monks, and spent seven years upon the ocean, in two voyages (according to the Irish text in the MS.
<i>book of Lismore</i>, which is probably the most archaic form of the legend), discovering this island and many
others equally marvellous, including one which turned out to be the back of a huge fish, upon which they celebrated
Easter. This story cannot be traced beyond the eleventh century, its oldest form being a Latin
prose version in a MS. of that century. It is known also in French, English, and German translations, both
prose and verse, and was evidently a great favorite in the Middle Ages. Intimately connected with the St.
Brandan legend is that of St. Malo, or Maclovius, Bishop of Aleth, in Armorica, a disciple of St. Brandan, who
accompanied his superior, and whose eulogists, jealous of the fame of the Irish saint, provided for the younger
a voyage on his own account, with marvels transcending those found by Brandan. His church-day is November
17th. The story of St. Brandan is given by Humboldt and D’Avezac,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and by Gaffarel.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Further
accounts will be found in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> of the Bollandists,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and in the introductions and notes to the
numerous editions of the voyages, among which reference only need be made to the original Latin edited by
M. Jubinal,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and to the English version edited by Thomas Wright for the Percy Society.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> A Latin text of the
fourteenth century is now to be found in the <i>Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae ex codice Salmanticensi nunc
premium integre edita opera C. de Smedt et J. de Backer</i> (Edinb. etc., 1888), 4to, pp. 111-154. As is well
known, Philoponus gives an account of the voyages of St. Brandan with a curious map, in which he places the
island N. W. of Spain and N. E. of the Canaries, or <i>Insulae Fortunatae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The island of St. Brandan was at
first apparently imagined in the north, but it afterward took a more southerly location. Honoré d’Autun
identifies it with a certain island called Perdita, once discovered and then lost in the Atlantic; we have here,
perhaps, some reminiscence of the name “Aprositos,” which Ptolemy bestows on one of the <i>Fortunatae
Insulae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> In some of the earlier maps there is an inlet on the west coast of Ireland called <i>Lacus Fortunatus</i>,
which is packed with islands which are called <i>Insulae Fortunatae</i> or <i>Beatae</i>, and sometimes given as 300 or
368 in number.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> But the Pizigani map of 1367 puts the <i>Isole dicte Fortunate S. Brandany</i> in the place of
Madeira; and Behaim’s globe, in 1492, sets it down in the latitude of Cape de Verde,&mdash;a legend against it
assigning the discovery to St. Brandan in 565.</p>

<p>It is this island which was long supposed to be seen as a mountainous land southeast of the Canaries.
After the discovery of the Azores expeditions were fitted out to search for it, and were continued until 1721,
which are described by Viera, and have been since retold by all writers on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The island was again
reported as seen in 1759.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Antillia, or Isle of Seven Cities.</span>&mdash;The largest of these islands, the one most persistent in its form
and location, is Antillia, which is depicted as a large rectangular island, extending from north to south, lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the mid-Atlantic about lat. 35° N. This island first appears on the map of 1424, preserved at Weimar, and
is found on the principal maps of the rest of the century, notably in the Bianco of 1436.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> On some maps of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries appears a smaller island under the name of Sette Citade, or Sete Ciudades,
which is properly another name for Antillia, as Toscanelli says in his famous letter, wherein he recommended
Antillia as likely to be useful as a way-station on the India voyage. We owe to Behaim the preservation on
his globe of 1492 of the legend of this island. It was discovered and settled, according to him, by refugees
from Spain in 714, after the defeat of King Roderick by the Moors. The settlers were accompanied by an
archbishop and six bishops, each of whom built him a town. There is a story that the island was rediscovered
by a Portuguese sailor in 1447.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>In apparent connection with <i>Antillia</i> are the smaller islands <i>Danmar</i> or <i>Tanmar</i>, <i>Reillo</i> or <i>Royllo</i>, and
<i>Satanaxio</i>. The latter alone is of special interest. Formaleoni found near Antillia, on the map of Bianco of
1436, an island with a name which he read as “Y.<sup>d</sup> laman Satanaxio,”&mdash;a name which much perplexed him,
until he found, in an old Italian romance, a legend that in a certain part of India a great hand arose every day
from the sea and carried off the inhabitants into the ocean. Adapting this tale to the west, he translated the
name “Island of the hand of Satan,”<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> in which interpretation Humboldt acquiesced. D’Avezac, however,
was inclined to think that there were two islands, one called Delamar, a name which elsewhere appears
as Danmar or Tanmar, and Satanaxio, or, as it appears on a map by Beccario at Parma, <i>Satanagio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> and suggests
that the word is a corrupt form for S. Atanaxio or S. Atanagio, i. e. St. Athanasius, with which Gaffarel
is inclined to agree.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Formaleoni saw in <i>Antillia</i> a foreknowledge of the Antilles, and Hassel believed that North and South
America were respectively represented by Satanaxio and Antillia, with a strait between, just as the American
continent was indeed represented after the discovery. It is certainly curious that Beccario designates the
group of Antillia, Satanagio, and Danmar, as <i>Isle de novo reperte</i>, the name afterwards applied to the discoveries
of Columbus; but it is not now believed that the fifteenth-century islands were aught but geographical
fancies. To transfer their names to the real discoveries was of course easy and natural.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Brazil</span>.&mdash;Among the islands which prefigured the Azores on fourteenth-century maps appears <i>I. de Brazi</i>
on the Medicean portulano of 1351, and it is apparently Terceira or San Miguel.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> On the Pizigani map of
1367 appear three islands with this name, <i>Insula de Bracir</i> or <i>Bracie</i>, two not far from the Azores, and one
off the south or southeast end of Ireland. On the Catalan map of 1375 is an <i>Insula de Brazil</i> in the southern
part of the so-called Azores group, and an <i>Insula de Brazil</i> (?) applied to a group of small islands enclosed
in a heavy black ring west of Ireland. The same reduplication occurs in the Solerio of 1385, in a map of 1426<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
preserved at Regensburg, in Bianco’s map of 1436, and in that of 1448: here <i>de Braxil</i> is the easternmost of
the Azores group (i. e. <i>y de Colombi, de Zorzi</i>, etc.), while the large round island&mdash;more like a large ink-blot
than anything else&mdash;west of Ireland is <i>y de Brazil d. binar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> In a map in St. Mark’s Library, Venice, dated
about 1450, Brazil appears in four places. Fra Mauro puts it west of Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> and it so appears in Ptolemy
of 1519, and Ramusio in 1556; but Mercator and Ortelius inscribe it northwest of the Azores.</p>

<p>Humboldt has shown<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> that brazil-wood, being imported into Europe from the East Indies long before the
discovery of America, gave its name to the country in the west where it was found in abundance, and he
infers that the designation of the Atlantic island was derived from the same source. The duplication of the
name, however, seems to point to a confusion of different traditions, and in the Brazil off Ireland we doubtless
have an attempt to establish the mythical island of <i>Hy Brazil</i>, or <i>O’Brasile</i>, which plays a part as a vanishing
island in Irish legends, although it cannot be traced to its origin. In the epic literature of Ireland relating to
events of the sixth and subsequent centuries, and which was probably written down in the twelfth, there are
various stories of ocean voyages, some involuntary, some voluntary, and several, like the voyage of the sons of
Ua Corra about 540, of St. Brandan about 560, and of Mailduin in the eighth century, taking place in the Atlantic,
and resulting in the discovery of numerous fabulous islands.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> The name of Brazil does not appear in these
early records, but it seems to belong to the same class of legends.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> It is first mentioned, as far as I know,
by William Betoner, called William of Worcester, who calls the island <i>Brasyle</i> and <i>Brasylle</i>, and says that
July 15, 1480, his brother-in-law, John Jay, began a voyage from Bristol in search of the island, returning
Sept. 18 without having found it.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> This evidently belongs to the series of voyages made by Bristol men in
search of this island, which is mentioned by Pedro d’Ayala, the Spanish ambassador to England, in his famous
letter of July 25, 1498, where he says that such voyages in search of <i>Brazylle</i> and the <i>seven cities</i> had been
made for seven years past, “according to the fancies of the Genoese,” meaning Sebastian Cabot.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>It would seem that the search for Brazil was of older date than Cabot’s arrival. He probably gave an
additional impetus to the custom, adding to the stories of the fairy isles the legends of the <i>Sette Citade</i> or
<i>Antillia</i>. Hardiman,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> quoting from a MS. history of Ireland, in the library of the Royal Irish Academy,
written about 1636, mentions an “iland, which lyeth far att sea, on the west of Connaught, and some times is
perceived by the inhabitants of the <i>Oules</i> and <i>Iris</i> ... and from Saint Helen Head. Like wise several seamen
have discovered it, ... one of whom, named Captain Rich, who lives about Dublin, of late years had a
view of the land, and was so neere that he discovered a harbour ... but could never make to land” because
of “a mist which fell upon him.... Allsoe in many old mappes ... you still find it by the name of <i>O’Brasile</i>
under the longitude of 03°, 00´, and the latitude of 50° 20´.”<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> In 1675 a pretended account of a visit to
this island was published in London, which is reprinted by Hardiman.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

by H. Halliday Sterling, <i>Irish Minstrelsy</i>, p. 307 (London, 1887). Mr. Marshall, in a note in <i>Notes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

R. O’Flaherty, <i>Ogygia, sive rerum Hibernicarum chronologiae</i> (London, 1685; also in English translation,
Dublin, 1793), as speaking of O’Brazile. The latter work I have not seen. Mr. Marshall also quotes
a familiar allusion to it by Jeremy Taylor (<i>Dissuasive from Popery</i>, 1667). This note was replied to in
the same periodical, Dec. 15, 1883, by Mr. Kerslake, “N.” and W. Fraser. Fraser’s interest had been
attracted by the entry of the island&mdash;much smaller than usual&mdash;on a map of the French Geographer Royal,
Le Sieur Tassin, 1634-1652, and he read a paper before the Geological Society of Ireland, Jan. 20, 1870, suggesting
that Brazil might be the present <i>Porcupine Bank</i>, once above water. On the same map <i>Rockall</i> is
laid down as two islands, where but a solitary rock is now known.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Brasil appears on the maps of the last
two centuries, with <i>Mayda</i> and <i>Isle Verte</i>, and even on the great Atlas by Jefferys, 1776, is inserted, although
called “imaginary island of O’Brasil.” It grows constantly smaller, but within the second half of this
century has appeared on the royal Admiralty charts as <i>Brazil Rock</i>.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>It would be too tedious to enumerate the numerous other imaginary islands of the Atlantic to which clouds,
fogs, and white caps have from time to time given rise. They are marked on all charts of the last century in
profusion; mention, however, may be made of the “land of <i>Bus</i>” or <i>Busse</i>, which Frobisher’s expedition
coasted along in 1576, and which has been hunted for with the lead even as late as 1821, though in vain.</p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n51" id="n51">F.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Toscanelli’s Atlantic Ocean</span>.&mdash;It has been shown elsewhere (Vol. II. pp. 30, 31, 38, 90, 101, 103)
that Columbus in the main accepted the view of the width of the Atlantic, on the farther side of which Asia
was supposed to be, which Toscanelli had calculated; and it has not been quite certain what actual measurement
should be given to this width, but recent discoveries tend to make easier a judgment in the matter.</p>

<p>When Humboldt wrote the <i>Examen Critique</i>, Toscanelli’s letter to Columbus, of unknown date,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> enclosing
a copy of the one he sent to Martinez in 1474, was known only in the Italian form in Ulloa’s translation of
the <i>Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo</i> (Venice, 1571), and in the Spanish translation of Ulloa’s version
by Barcia in the <i>Historiades primitivos de las Indias occidentales</i> (Madrid, 1749), i. 5 bis, which was reprinted
by Navarrete, <i>Coleccion de los viages y descubrimientos</i>, etc., ii. p. 1. In the letter to Martinez, in this form, it
is said that there are in the map which accompanied it twenty-six <i>spaces</i> between Lisbon and <i>Quisai</i>, each
space containing 250 miles according to the Ulloa version, but according to the re-translation of Barcia 150
miles. This, with several other changes made by Barcia, were followed by Navarrete and accepted as correct
by Humboldt, who severely censures Ximenes for adopting the Italian rendering in his <i>Gnomone fiorent</i>.
But the Latin copy of the letter in Columbus’s handwriting, discovered by Harrisse and made public (with
fac-simile) in his <i>D. Fernando Colon</i> (Seville, 1871),<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> sustained the correctness of Ulloa’s version, giving 250
miliaria to the space. This authoritative rendering also showed that while the translator had in general followed
the text, he had twice inserted a translation of miles into degrees, and once certainly, incorrectly, making
in one place 100 miles = 35 leagues, and in another, 2,500 miles = 225 leagues. Probably this discrepancy
led to the omissions made by Barcia; he was wrong, however, in changing the number 250, supposing the 150
not to be a typographical error, and in omitting the phrase, “which space (from Lisbon to Quinsai) is about
the third part of the sphere.” The Latin text showed, too, that this whole passage about distances was not in
the Martinez letter at all, but formed the end of the letter to Columbus, since in the Latin it follows the date
of the Martinez letter, into which it has been interpolated by a later hand. Finally the publication of Las
Casas’s <i>Historia de las Indias</i> (Madrid, 1875) gave us another Spanish version, which differs from Barcia’s
in closely agreeing with the Ulloa version, and which gives the length of a space at 250 miles.</p>

<p>There were then 26 × 250 = 6500 miles between Lisbon and Quinsai, and this was about one third of the circumference
of the earth in this latitude, but it is not clear whether Roman or Italian miles were meant.</p>

<p>If the MS. in the Biblioteca Nazionale at Florence [<i>Cod. Magliabechiano Classe</i> xi. <i>num.</i> 121], described by
G. Uzielli in the <i>Bollettino della Società Geografica Italiana</i>, x. 1 (1873), 13-28 (“Ricerche intorno a Paolo dal
Pozzo Toscanelli, ii. Della grandezza della terra secondo Paolo Toscanelli”), actually represents the work of
Toscanelli, it is of great value in settling this point. The MS. is inscribed “Discorso di M<sup>o</sup> Paolo Puteo Toscanelli
sopra la cometa del 1456.” In it were found two papers: 1. A plain projection in rectangular form
apparently for use in sketching a map. It is divided into spaces, each subdivided into five degrees, and numbers
36 spaces in length. It is believed by Sig. Uzielli that this is the form used in the map sent to Martinez.
If this be so, the 26 spaces between Lisbon and Quinsai = 130°. 2. A list of the latitude and longitude of
various localities, at the end of which is inscribed this table:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Gradus continet .68 miliaria minus 3ª unius.<br />
Miliarum tria millia bracchia.<br />
Bracchium duos palmas.<br />
Palmus. 12. uncias. 7. filos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The Florentine mile of 3,000 braccia da terra contains, according to Sig. Uzielli, 1653.6<sup>m</sup>. (as against
1481<sup>m</sup>. to the Roman mile). Hence Toscanelli estimated a degree of the meridian at 111,927<sup>m</sup>, or only 552<sup>m</sup>.
more than the mean adopted by Bessel and Bayer. Since, according to the letter, one space = 250 miles, and by
the map one space = 5°, we have 50 miles to a degree, which would point to an estimate for a latitude of about
42°, allowing 67 2-3 miles to an equatorial degree. Lisbon was entered in the table of Alphonso at 41° N. (true
lat. 38° 41’ N.) By this reckoning Quinsai would fall 124° west of Lisbon or 10° west of San Francisco. It
does not appear that the Florence MS. can be traced directly to Toscanelli, but the probability is certainly strong
that we have here some of the astronomer’s working papers, and that Ximenes did not deserve the rebuke
administered by Humboldt for allowing 250 miles to a space, and assuming that a space contained five degrees.
Certainly Humboldt’s use of 150 miles is unjustifiable, and his calculation of 52° as the angular distance
between Lisbon and Quinsai, according to Toscanelli, is very much too small, whatever standard we take for the
mile. If we follow Uzielli, the result obtained by Ruge (<i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>, p. 230),
104°, is also too small.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

Ocean is, even down to our own day, an odd mixture of uncertain fact and positive fable. The island
of Bresil or Brazil was only left off the British Admiralty charts within twenty years (see Vol. II. p. 36),
and editions of the most popular atlases, like Colton’s, within twenty-five years have shown Jacquet Island,
the Three Chimneys, Maida, and others lying in the mid-sea. It may possibly be a fair question if some

to give the Canaries, Madeira, and the Azores better than any earlier one. One of these maps (1367) is in
the national library at Parma, and the other (1373) is in the Ambrosian library at Milan (<i>Studi biog. e
bibliog.</i>, vol. ii. pp. viii, 57, 58). The 1367 map is given by Jomard and Santarem. The most famous of all
these early maps is the Catalan Mappemonde of 1375, preserved in the great library at Paris. It gives the
Canaries and other islands further north, but does not reach to the Azores.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> These last islands are included,

<p>We come now to the conditions of the Atlantic cartography
immediately preceding the voyage of Columbus.
The most prominent specimens of this period
are the various marine charts of Grogioso and Andreas
Benincasa from 1461 to 1490. Some of these are given
by Santarem, Lelewel, and St. Martin; but the best
enumeration of them is given in the <i>Studi biog. e
bibliog. della Soc. Geog. Ital.</i> ii. 66, 77-84, 92, 99, 100.
Of Toscanelli’s map of 1474, which influenced Columbus,
we have no sketch, though some attempts have
been made to reconstruct it from descriptions.
(Cf. Vol. II. p. 103; Harrisse’s <i>Christophe Colomb.</i>,
i. 127, 129.) Brief mention may also be
made of the Laon globe of 1486 (dated 1493), of
which D’Avezac gives a projection in the <i>Bulletin
de la Soc. de Géog.</i> xx. 417; of the Majorcan
(Catalan) Carta nautica of about 1487 (cf. <i>Studi</i>,
etc., ii. no. 397; <i>Bull. Soc. Géog.</i>, i. 295); of the
chart in the Egerton MSS., Brit. Mus., made by
Christofalo Soligo about the same time, and which
has no dearth of islands (cf. <i>Studi</i>, etc., i. 89); of
those of Nicola Fiorin, Canepa, and Giacomo
Bertran (<i>Studi</i>, etc., ii. 82, 86, and no. 398). The
globe of Behaim (1492) gives the very latest of
these ante-Columbian views (see Vol. II. 105).</p>

<p>It took, after this, a long time for the Atlantic
to be cleared, even partially, of these intrusive
islands, and to bring the proper ones into accurate
relations. How the old ideas survived may be
traced in the maps of Ruysch, 1508 (Vol. II. 115);
Coppo, 1528, with its riot of islands (II. 127);
Mercator, 1541 (II. 177); Bordone, 1547; Zaltière,

<p class="drop-cap04">IN the previous chapter, in attempting to trace the possible connection
of the new world with the old in the dimmest past, it was hard, if not
hopeless, to find among the entangled myths a path that we could follow
with any confidence into the field of demonstrable history. It is still a
doubt how far we exchange myths for assured records, when we enter upon
the problems of pre-Columbian explorations, which it is the object of the
present chapter to discuss. We are to deal with supposable colonizations,
from which the indigenous population of America, as the Spaniards found
it, was sprung, wholly or in part; and we are to follow the venturesome
habits of navigators, who sought experience and commerce in a strange
country, and only incidentally left possible traces of their blood in the peoples
they surprised. If Spain, Italy, and England gained consequence by
the discoveries of Columbus and Cabot, there were other national prides to
be gratified by the priority which the Basques, the Normans, the Welsh, the
Irish, and the Scandinavians, to say nothing of Asiatic peoples, claimed as
their share in the gift of a new world to the old. The records which these
peoples present as evidences of their right to be considered the forerunners
of the Spanish and English expeditions have in every case been questioned
by those who are destitute of the sympathetic credence of a common kinship.
The claims which Columbus and Cabot fastened upon Spain and
England, to the disadvantage of Italy, who gave to those rival countries
their maritime leaders, were only too readily rejected by Italy herself, when
the opportunity was given to her of paling such borrowed glories before
the trust which she placed in the stories of the Zeni brothers.</p>

<p class="p2">There is not a race of eastern Asia&mdash;Siberian, Tartar, Chinese, Japanese,
Malay, with the Polynesians&mdash;which has not been claimed as discoverers,
intending or accidental, of American shores, or as progenitors, more
or less perfect or remote, of American peoples; and there is no good reason
why any one of them may not have done all that is claimed. The historical
evidence, however, is not such as is based on documentary proofs of
indisputable character, and the recitals advanced are often far from precise
enough to be convincing in details, if their general authenticity is allowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Nevertheless, it is much more than barely probable that the ice of Behring
Straits or the line of the Aleutian Islands was the pathway of successive
immigrations, on occasions perhaps far apart, or may be near together; and
there is hardly a stronger demonstration of such a connection between the
two continents than the physical resemblances of the peoples now living on
opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean in these upper latitudes, with the similarity
of the flora which environs them on either shore.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> It is quite as conceivable
that the great northern current, setting east athwart the Pacific,
should from time to time have carried along disabled vessels, and stranded
them on the shores of California and farther north, leading to the infusion
of Asiatic blood among whatever there may have been antecedent or autochthonous
in the coast peoples. It is certainly in this way possible that
the Chinese or Japanese may have helped populate the western slopes of
the American continent. There is no improbability even in the Malays of
southeastern Asia extending step by step to the Polynesian islands, and
among them and beyond them, till the shores of a new world finally received
the impress of their footsteps and of their ethnic characteristics. We may
very likely recognize not proofs, but indications, along the shores of South
America, that its original people constituted such a stock, or were increased
by it.</p>

<p class="p2">As respects the possible early connections of America on the side of
Europe, there is an equally extensive array of claims, and they have been
set forth, first and last, with more persistency than effect.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Leaving the old world by the northern passage, Iceland lies at the threshold
of America. It is nearer to Greenland than to Norway, and Greenland
is but one of the large islands into which the arctic currents divide the
North American continent. Thither, to Iceland, if we identify the localities
in Geoffrey of Monmouth, King Arthur sailed as early as the beginning
of the sixth century, and overcame whatever inhabitants he may have
found there. Here too an occasional wandering pirate or adventurous Dane
had glimpsed the coast.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Thither, among others, came the Irish, and in the
ninth century we find Irish monks and a small colony of their countrymen
in possession.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> Thither the Gulf Stream carries the southern driftwood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
suggesting sunnier lands to whatever race had been allured or driven to its
shelter.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Here Columbus, when, as he tells us,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> he visited the island in
1477, found no ice. So that, if we may place reliance on the appreciable
change of climate by the precession of the equinoxes, a thousand years ago
and more, when the Norwegians crossed from Scandinavia and found these
Christian Irish there,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> the island was not the forbidding spot that it seems
with the lapse of centuries to be becoming.</p>

is given as representing the vessel found at Sandefjord in 1880. It is drawn from the restoration given in <i>The
Viking ship discovered at Gokstad in Norway (Langskibet fra Gokstad ved Sandefjord) described by N.
Nicholaysen</i> (Christiania, 1882). The original vessel owed its preservation to being used as a receptacle for
the body of a Viking chief, when he was buried under a mound. When exhumed, its form, with the sepulchral
chamber midships, could be made out, excepting that the prow and stern in their extremities had to be restored.
In the ship and about it were found, beside some of the bones of a man, various appurtenances of the vessel,
and the remains of horses buried with him. They are all described in the book above cited, from which the
other cuts herewith given of the plan of the vessel and one of its rowlocks are taken. The <i>Popular Science
Monthly</i>, May, 1881, borrowing from <i>La Nature</i>, gives a view of the ship as when found <i>in situ</i>. There are

<p>There is a paper on the daring of the Norsemen as navigators by G. Brynjalfson (<i>Compte Rendu , Congrès

pôle arctique dans leurs expéditions à la mer glaciale?”</p>

<p>It was in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 875 that Ingolf, a jarl<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> of Norway, came to Iceland with
Norse settlers. They built their habitation at first where a pleasant headland
seemed attractive, the present Ingolfshofdi, and later founded Reikjavik,
where the signs had directed them; for certain carved posts, which
they had thrown overboard as they approached the island, were found to
have drifted to that spot. The Christian Irish preferred to leave their
asylum rather than consort with the new-comers, and so the island was
left to be occupied by successive immigrations of the Norse, which their
king could not prevent. In the end, and within half a century, a hardy
little republic&mdash;as for a while it was&mdash;of near seventy thousand inhabitants
was established almost under the arctic circle. The very next year
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 876) after Ingolf had come to Iceland, a sea-rover, Gunnbiorn,
driven in his ship westerly, sighted a strange land, and the report that he
made was not forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Fifty years later, more or less, for we must treat
the dates of the Icelandic sagas with some reservation, we learn that a
wind-tossed vessel was thrown upon a coast far away, which was called Ireland
the Great. Then again we read of a young Norwegian, Eric the Red,
not apparently averse to a brawl, who killed his man in Norway and fled to
Iceland, where he kept his dubious character; and again outraging the
laws, he was sent into temporary banishment,&mdash;this time in a ship which
he fitted out for discovery; and so he sailed away in the direction of Gunnbiorn’s
land, and found it. He whiled away three years on its coast, and as
soon as he was allowed ventured back with the tidings, while, to propitiate
intending settlers, he said he had been to Greenland, and so the land got a
sunny name. The next year, which seems to have been <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 985, he
started on his return with thirty-five ships, but only fourteen of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
reached the land. Wherever there was a habitable fiord, a settlement grew
up, and the stream of immigrants was for a while constant and considerable.
Just at the end of the century (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 999), Leif, a son of Eric, sailed back to
Norway, and found the country in the early fervor of a new religion; for
King Olaf Tryggvesson had embraced Christianity and was imposing it on
his people. Leif accepted the new faith, and a priest was assigned to him
to take back to Greenland; and thus Christianity was introduced into arctic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
America. So they began to build churches<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> in Greenland, the considerable
ruins of one of which stand to this day.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The winning of Iceland to the
Church was accomplished at the same time.</p>

<p>There were two centres of settlement on the Greenland coast, not where
they were long suspected to be, on the coast opposite Iceland, nor as supposed
after the explorations of Baffin’s Bay, on both the east and west side
of the country; but the settlers seem to have reached and doubled Cape
Farewell, and so formed what was called their eastern settlement (Eystribygd),
near the cape, while farther to the north they formed their western
colony (Westribygd).<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Their relative positions are still involved in doubt.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">ROWLOCK OF THE VIKING SHIP.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the next year after the second voyage of Eric the Red, one of the
ships which were sailing from Iceland to the new settlement, was driven
far off her course, according to the sagas, and Bjarni Herjulfson, who commanded
the vessel, reported that he had come upon a land, away to the
southwest, where the coast country was level; and he added that when he
turned north it took him nine days to reach Greenland.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Fourteen years
later than this voyage of Bjarni, which is said to have been in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 986,&mdash;that
is, in the year 1000 or thereabouts,&mdash;Leif, the same who had brought
the Christian priest to Greenland, taking
with him thirty-five companions, sailed
from Greenland in quest of the land seen
by Bjarni, which Leif first found, where
a barren shore stretched back to ice-covered
mountains, and because of the
stones there he called the region Hellu
land. Proceeding farther south, he found
a sandy shore, with a level forest-country
back of it, and because of the woods it
was named Markland. Two days later
they came upon other land, and tasting the dew upon the grass they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it sweet. Farther south and westerly they went, and going up a river came
into an expanse of water, where on the shores they built huts to lodge in
for the winter, and sent out exploring parties. In one of these, Tyrker, a
native of a part of Europe where grapes grew, found vines hung with their
fruit, which induced Leif to call the country Vinland.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to identify these various regions by the inexact
accounts of the direction of their sailing, by the very general descriptions
of the country, by the number of days occupied in going from one point to
another, with the uncertainty if the ship sailed at night, and by the length
of the shortest day in Vinland,&mdash;the last a statement that might help us,
if it could be interpreted with a reasonable concurrence of opinion, and if it
were not confused with other inexplicable statements. The next year Leif’s
brother, Thorvald, went to Vinland with a single ship, and passed three winters
there, making explorations meanwhile, south and north. Thorfinn Karlsefne,
arriving in Greenland in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1006, married a courageous widow
named Gudrid, who induced him to sail with his ships to Vinland and make
there a permanent settlement, taking with him livestock and other necessaries
for colonization. Their first winter in the place was a severe one; but
Gudrid gave birth to a son, Snorre, from whom it is claimed Thorwaldsen,
the Danish sculptor, was descended. The next season they removed to the
spot where Leif had wintered, and called the bay Hóp. Having spent a
third winter in the country, Karlsefne, with a part of the colony, returned
to Greenland.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The saga then goes on to say that trading voyages to the settlement
which had been formed by Karlsefne now became frequent, and that the
chief lading of the return voyages was timber, which was much needed in
Greenland. A bishop of Greenland, Eric Upsi, is also said to have gone to
Vinland in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1121. In 1347 the last ship of which we have any record
in these sagas went to Vinland after timber. After this all is oblivion.</p>

<p>There are in all these narratives many details beyond this outline, and
those who have sought to identify localities have made the most they could
of the mention of a rock here or a bluff there, of an island where they
killed a bear, of others where they found eggs, of a headland where they
buried a leader who had been killed, of a cape shaped like a keel, of broadfaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
natives who offered furs for red cloths, of beaches where they hauled
up their ships, and of tides that were strong; but the more these details
are scanned in the different sagas the more they confuse the investigator,
and the more successive relators try to enlighten us the more our doubts
are strengthened, till we end with the conviction that all attempts at consistent
unravelment leave nothing but a vague sense of something somewhere
done.</p>

<p class="pf400">This cut is of some of the oldest runes known, giving two lines in Danish and the rest in Latin, as the
transliteration shows. It is copied from <i>The oldest yet found Document in Danish, by Prof Dr. George Stephens</i>
(Copenhagen, 1888,&mdash;from the <i>Mémoires des Antiquaires du Nord</i>, 1887). The author says that the
leaden tablet on which the runes were cut was found in Odense, Fyn, Denmark, in 1883, and he places the
date of it about the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1000.<br />
George Stephens’s <i>Handbook of the old Northern Runic Monuments of Scandinavia and England</i> is a
condensation, preserving all the cuts, and making some additions to his larger folio work in 3 vols., <i>The
old-northern Runic monuments of Scandinavia and England, now first collected and deciphered</i> (London,
etc., 1866-68). It does not contain either Icelandic or Greenland runes. He says that by the time of the colonization
of Iceland “the old northern runes as a system had died out on the Scandinavian main, and were
followed by the later runic alphabet. But even this modern Icelandic of the tenth century has not come
down to us. If it had, it would be very different from what is now vulgarly so called, which is the greatly
altered Icelandic of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.... The oldest written Icelandic known to us is
said to date from about the year 1200.... The whole modern doctrine of one uniform Icelandic language
all over the immense north in the first one thousand winters after Christ is an impossible absurdity.... It is
very seldom that any of the Scandinavian runic stones bear a date.... No Christian runic gravestone is
older than the fourteenth century.”<br />
On runes in general, see Mallet, Bohn’s ed., pp. 227, 248, following the cut of the Kingektorsoak stone, in
Rafn’s <i>Antiq. Americanæ</i>; Wilson’s <i>Prehist. Man</i>, ii. 88; Wollheim’s <i>Nat. Lit. der Scandinavier</i> (Berlin,

<i>Pre-Columb. Disc.</i>, pp. xxx; <i>Revue polit. et lit.</i>, Jan. 10, 1880.<br />
It is held that runes are an outgrowth of the Latin alphabet. (L. F. A. Wimmer’s <i>Runeskriftens Oprindelse

<p>Everywhere else where the Northmen went they left proofs of their occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the soil, but nowhere in America, except on an island on the east
shore of Baffin’s Bay,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> has any authentic runic inscription been found outside
of Greenland. Not a single indisputable grave has been discovered to
attest their alleged centuries of fitful occupation. The consistent and natural
proof of any occupation of America south of Davis Straits is therefore
lacking; and there is not sufficient particularity in the descriptions<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> to
remove the suspicion that the story-telling of the fireside has overlaid the
reports of the explorer. Our historic sense is accordingly left to consider,
as respects the most general interpretation, what weight of confidence
should be yielded to the sagas, pre-Columbian as they doubtless are. But
beyond this is perhaps, what is after all the most satisfactory way of solving
the problem, a dependence on the geographical and ethnical probabilities
of the case. The Norsemen have passed into credible history as the most
hardy and venturesome of races. That they colonized Iceland and Greenland
is indisputable. That their eager and daring nature should have deserted
them at this point is hardly conceivable. Skirting the Greenland
shores and inuring themselves to the hardships and excitements of northern
voyaging, there was not a long stretch of open sea before they could strike
the Labrador coast. It was a voyage for which their ships, with courageous
crews, were not unfitted. Nothing is more likely than that some ship of
theirs may have been blown westerly and unwillingly in the first instance,
just as Greenland was in like manner first made known to the Icelanders.
The coast once found, to follow it to the south would have been their most
consistent action.</p>

The ruins of churches and baptisteries give a color of truth to the ecclesiastical
annals which have come down to us, and which indicate that after
having been for more than a century under the Bishop of Iceland, a succession
of bishops of its own was established there early in the twelfth century.
The names of seventeen prelates are given by Torfæus, though it is
not quite certain that the bishops invariably visited their see. The last
known to have filled the office went thither in the early years of the fifteenth
century. The last trace of him is in the celebration of a marriage
at Gardar in 1409.</p>

<p>The Greenland colonists were equipped with all the necessities of a permanent
life. They had horses, sheep, and oxen, and beef is said to have been
a regular article of export to Norway. They had buildings of stone, of which
the remains still exist. They doubtless brought timber from the south, and
we have in runic records evidence of their explorations far to the north.
They maintained as late as the thirteenth century a regular commercial intercourse
with the mother country,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> but this trade fell into disuse when
a royal mandate constituted such ventures a monopoly of the throne; and
probably nothing so much conduced to the decadence and final extinction
of the colonies as this usurped and exclusive trade, which cut off all personal
or conjoined intercourse.</p>

<p>The direct cause of the final extinction of the Greenland colonies is involved
in obscurity, though a variety of causes, easily presumable, would
have been sufficient, when we take into consideration the moribund condition
into which they naturally fell after commercial restriction had put a
stop to free intercourse with the home government.</p>

<p>The Eskimos are said to have appeared in Greenland about the middle
of the fourteenth century, and to have manifested hostility to such a degree
that about 1342 the imperilled western colony was abandoned. The
eastern colony survived perhaps seventy years longer, or possibly to a still
later period. We know they had a new bishop in 1387, but before the end
of that century the voyages to their relief were conducted only after long
intervals.</p>

<p>Before communication was wholly cut off, the attacks of the Skrælings,
and possibly famine and the black death, had carried the struggling colonists
to the verge of destruction. Bergen, in Norway, upon which they depended
for succor, had at one time been almost depopulated by the same
virulent disease, and again had been ravaged by a Hanseatic fleet. Thus
such intercourse as the royal monopoly permitted had become precarious,
and the marauding of freebooters, then prevalent in northern waters, still
further served to impede the communications, till at last they wholly ceased,
during the early years of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>It has sometimes been maintained that the closing in of ice-packs was
the final stroke which extinguished the last hopes of the expiring colonists.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
This view, however, meets with little favor among the more enlightened
students of climatic changes, like Humboldt.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>There has been published what purports to be a bull of Pope Nicholas V,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
directing the Bishop of Iceland to learn what he could of the condition
of the Greenland colonies, and in this document it is stated that part of
the colonists had been destroyed by barbarians thirty years before,&mdash;the
bull bearing date in 1448. There is no record that any expedition followed
upon this urging, and there is some question as to the authenticity of the
document.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> In the <i>Relation</i> of La Peyrère there is a story of some sailors
visiting Greenland so late as 1484; but it is open to question.</p>

<p class="p2">Early in the sixteenth century fitful efforts to learn the fate of the colonies
began, and these were continued, without result, well into the seventeenth
century; but nothing explicable was ascertained till, in 1721, Hans Egede,
a Norwegian priest, prevailed upon the Danish government to send him on
a mission to the Eskimos. He went, accompanied by wife and children;
and the colony of Godthaab, and the later history of the missions, and the
revival of trade with Europe, attest the constancy of his purpose and the
fruits of his earnestness. In a year he began to report upon certain
remains which indicated the former occupation of the country by people
who built such buildings as was the habit in Europe. He and his son Paul
Egede, and their successors in the missions, gathered for us, first among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
modern searchers, the threads of the history of this former people; and,
as time went on, the researches of Graah, Nordenskjöld, and other explorers,
and the studious habits of Major, Rink, and the rest among the investigators,
have enabled us to read the old sagas of the colonization of
Greenland with renewed interest and with the light of corroborating
evidence.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>We are told that it was one result of these Northman voyages that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
fame of them spread to other countries, and became known among the
Welsh, at a time when, upon the death of Owen Gwynedd, who ruled in
the northern parts of that country, the people were embroiled in civil strife.
That chieftain’s son, Prince Madoc, a man bred to the sea, was discontented
with the unstable state of society, and resolved to lead a colony to these
western lands, where they could live more in peace.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1170, going seaward on a preliminary exploration by the south of Ireland,
he steered west, and established a pioneer colony in a fertile land. Leaving
here 120 persons, he returned to Wales, and fitted out a larger expedition
of ten ships, with which he again sailed, and passed out of view forever.
The evidence in support of this story is that it is mentioned in early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
annals, and that sundry persons have discovered traces of the Welsh
tongue among the lighter-colored American Indians, to say nothing of
manifold legends among the Indians of an original people, white in color,
coming from afar towards the northeast,&mdash;proofs not sufficient to attract
the confidence of those who look for historical tests, though, as Humboldt
contends,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> there may be no impossibility in the story.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There seems to be a general agreement that a crew of Arabs, somewhere
about the eleventh or twelfth century, explored the Atlantic westward,
with the adventurous purpose of finding its further limits, and that they
reached land, which may have been the Canaries, or possibly the Azores,
though the theory that they succeeded in reaching America is not without
advocates. The main source of the belief is the historical treatise of the
Arab geographer Edrisi, whose work was composed about the middle of
the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>In the latter part of the fourteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> as the story goes, two
brothers of Venice, Nicolo and Antonio Zeno, being on a voyage in the
North Atlantic were wrecked there, and lived for some years at Frislanda,
and visited Engroneland. During this northern sojourn they encountered
a sailor, who, after twenty-six years of absence, had returned, and reported
that the ship in which he was had been driven west in a gale to an island,
where he found civilized people, who possessed books in Latin and could
not speak Norse, and whose country was called Estotiland; while a region
on the mainland, farther south, to which he had also gone, was called
Drogeo, and that here he had encountered cannibals. Still farther south
was a great country with towns and temples. This information, picked up
by these exiled Zeni, was finally conveyed to another brother in Venice,
accompanied by a map of these distant regions. These documents long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
remained in the family palace in Venice, and were finally neglected and
became obscured, until at last a descendant of the family compiled from
them, as best he could, a book, which was printed in Venice in 1558 as
<i>Dei Commentarii del Viaggio</i>, which was accompanied by a map drawn
with difficulty from the half obliterated original which had been sent from
Frislanda.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The original documents were never produced, and the publication
took place opportunely to satisfy current curiosity, continually incited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by the Spanish discoveries. It was also calculated to appeal to the national
pride of Italy, which had seen Spain gain the glory of her own sons, Columbus
and Vespucius, if it could be established that these distant regions, of
which the Zeni brothers so early reported tidings, were really the great
new world.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> The cartography of the sixteenth century shows that the
narrative and its accompanying map made an impression on the public
mind, but from that day to this it has been apparent that there can be no
concurrence of opinion as to what island the Frislanda of the Zeni was, if
it existed at all except in some disordered or audacious mind; and, as a
matter of course, the distant regions of Estotiland and Drogeo have been
equally the subject of belief and derision. No one can be said wholly to
have taken the story out of the category of the uncertain.</p>

which can perhaps be easily explained on this hypothesis;<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> there are said
to be unusual linguistic correspondences in the American tongues with

and it is even asserted that it was a Basque mariner, who had been on the

World.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

early discovery of Newfoundland, in 1463-64, by John Vas Costa Cortereal
was set forth by Barrow in his <i>Chronological Hist. of Voyages into the
Arctic Regions</i> (London, 1818); but he stands almost alone in his belief.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
Biddle in his <i>Cabot</i> has shown its great improbability.</p>

<p>In the years while Columbus was nourishing his purpose of a western voyage,
there were two adventurous navigators, as alleged, who were breasting
the dangers of the Sea of Darkness both to the north and to the south. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
cannot be said that either the Pole Skolno, in his skirting the Labrador coasts
in 1476,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> or the Norman Cousin, who is thought to have traversed a part of

into the accepted truths of history; but there was nothing improbable in
what was said of them, and they flourish as counter-rumors always survive
when attendant upon some great revelation like that of Columbus.</p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n76" id="n76"></a>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Early Connection of Asiatic Peoples
with the Western Coast of America</span>.&mdash;
The question of the origin of the Americans,
whether an autochthonous one or associated
with the continents beyond either ocean, is more
properly discussed in another place of the present
volume. We can only indicate here in
brief such of the phases of the question as suppose
an Asiatic connection, and the particular
lines of communication.</p>

<p>The ethnic unity of the American races, as
urged by Morton and others, hardly meets the
requirements of the problem in the opinion of
most later students, like Sir Daniel Wilson, for
instance; and yet, if A. H. Keane represents, as
he claims, the latest ethnological beliefs, the
connection with Asia, of the kind that forms
ethnic traces, must have been before the history
of the present Asiatic races, since the correspondence
of customs, etc. is not sufficient for
more recent affiliation.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> It should be remembered
also, that if this is true, and if there is
the strong physical resemblance between Asiatics
and the indigenous tribes of the northwest
coast which early travellers and physiologists
have dwelt on, we have in such a correspondence
strong evidence of the persistency of types.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>The Asiatic theory was long a favorite one.
So popular a book as Lafitau’s <i>Mœurs des Sauvages</i>
(Paris, 1724) advocated it. J. B. Scherer’s
<i>Recherches historiques et géographiques sur
le nouveau monde</i> (Paris, 1777) was on the
same side. One of the earliest in this country,
Benj. Smith Barton, to give expression to American
scholarship in this field held like opinions
in his <i>New Views of the Origin of the Tribes of
America</i> (Philad., 1797).<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Twenty years later
(1816) one of the most active of the American
men of letters advocated the same views,&mdash;Samuel
L. Mitchell in the <i>Archæologia Americana</i>
(i. 325, 338, 346). The weightiest authority
of his time, Alex. von Humboldt, formulated
his belief in several of his books: <i>Vues
des Cordillères; Ansichten der Natur; Cosmos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Of the northern routes, that by Behring’s
Straits is the most apparent, and Lyell says
that when half-way over Dover Straits, which
have not far from the same dimensions, he saw
both the English and French shores at the
same time, he was easily convinced that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
passage by Behring’s Straits solved many of
the difficulties of the American problem.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>The problem as to the passage by the Aleutian
Islands is converted into the question
whether primitive people could have successfully
crossed an interval from Asia of 130 miles
to reach the island Miedna, 126 more to Behring’s
Island, and then 235 to Attu, the westernmost
of the Aleutian Islands, or nearly 500 miles
in all, and to have crossed in such numbers as to
affect the peopling of the new continent. There
are some, like Winchell, who see no difficulty in
the case.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> There are no authenticated relics, it
is believed, to prove the Tartar occupancy of
the northwest of America.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> That there have
been occasional estrays upon the coasts of
British Columbia, Oregon, and California, by
the drifting thither of Chinese and Japanese
junks, is certainly to be believed; but the argument
against their crews peopling the country
is usually based upon the probable absence of
women in them,&mdash;an argument that certainly
does not invalidate the belief in an infusion of
Asiatic blood in a previous race.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>The easterly passage which has elicited most
interest is one alleged to have been made by
some Buddhist priests to a country called Fusang,
and in proof of it there is cited the narrative
of one Hœi-Shin, who is reported to have
returned to China in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 499. Beside much
in the story that is ridiculous and impossible,
there are certain features which have led some
commentators to believe that the coast of Mexico
was intended, and that the Mexican maguey
plant was the tree fusang, after which the
country is said to have been called. The story
was first brought to the attention of Europeans
in 1761, when De Guignes published his paper
on the subject in the 28th volume (pp. 505-26)
of the Academy of Inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> It seems to
have attracted little attention till J. H. von
Klaproth, in 1831, discredited the American
theory in his “Recherches sur le pays de Fousang,”
published in the <i>Nouvelles Annales des
Voyages</i> (2d ser., vol. xxi.), accompanied by a
chart. In 1834 there appeared at Paris a French
translation, <i>Annales des Empereurs du Japon</i>
(<i>Nipon o dai itsi rau</i>), to which (vol. iv.) Klaproth
appended an “Aperçu de l’histoire mythologique
du Japon,” in which he returned to the
subject, and convinced Humboldt at least,<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> that
the country visited was Japan, and not Mexico,
though he could but see striking analogies, as
he thought, in the Mexican myths and customs
to those of the Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>In 1841, Karl Friedrich Neumann, in the <i>Zeitschrift
für allgemeine Erdkunde</i> (new series, vol.
xvi.), published a paper on “Ost Asien und
West Amerika nach Chinesischen Quellen aus
dem fünften, sechsten und siebenten Jahrhundert,”
in which he gave a version of the Hœi-shin
(Hœi-schin, Hui-shën) narrative, which
Chas. G. Leland, considering it a more perfect
form of the original than that given by De
Guignes, translated into English in <i>The Knickerbocker
Mag.</i> (1850), xxxvi. 301, as “California

<p>The next to discuss the question, and in an
affirmative spirit, was Charles Hippolyte de
Paravey, in the <i>Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne</i>
(Feb., 1844), whose paper was published
separately as <i>L’Amérique sous le nom de pays de
Fou-Sang, est elle citée dès le 5<sup>e</sup> siècle de notre ère,
dans les grandes annales de la Chine</i>, etc. <i>Discussion
ou dissertation abrégée, où l’affirmative est
prouvée</i> (Paris, 1844); and in 1847 he published
<i>Nouvelles preuves que le pays du Fousang est
l’Amérique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>The controversy as between De Guignes and
Klaproth was shared, in 1862, by Gustave
d’Eichthal, taking the Frenchman’s side, in the
<i>Revue Archéologique</i> (vol. ii.), and finally in his
<i>Etudes sur les origines Bouddhiques de la civilisation
Américaine</i> (Paris, 1865).<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>In 1870, E. Bretschneider, in his “Fusang, or
who discovered America?” in the <i>Chinese Recorder
and Missionary Journal</i> (Foochow, Oct.,
1870), contended that the whole story was the
fabrication of a lying priest.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>In 1875 there was new activity in discussing
the question. Two French writers of considerable
repute in such studies attracted attention:
the one, Lucien Adam, in the Congrès des Américanistes
at Nancy (<i>Compte Rendu</i>, i. 145); and
the other, Léon de Rosny, entered the discussions
at the same session (<i>Ibid.</i> i. p. 131).<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>The most conspicuous study for the English
reader was Charles Godfrey Leland’s <i>Fusang, or
The discovery of America by Chinese Buddhist
priests in the fifth century</i> (London, 1875).<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>The Marquis d’Hervey de Saint Denis published
in the <i>Actes de la Soc. d’Ethnographie</i>
(1869), vol. vi., and later in the <i>Comptes Rendus</i>
of the French Academy of Inscriptions, a <i>Mémoire
sur le pays connu des anciens Chinois sous
le nom de Fousang, et sur quelques documents
inédits pour servir à l’identifier</i>, which was
afterwards published separately in Paris, 1876,
in which he assented to the American theory.
The student of the subject need hardly go, however,
beyond E. P. Vining’s <i>An inglorious Columbus:
or, Evidence that Hwui Shăn and a
party of Buddhist monks from Afghanistan discovered
America in the fifth century</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> (New
York, 1885), since the compiler has made it a
repository of all the essential contributions to
the question from De Guignes down. He gives
the geographical reasons for believing Fusang
to be Mexico (ch. 20), comparing the original
description of Fusang with the early accounts
of aboriginal Mexico, and rehearsing the traditions,
as is claimed, of the Buddhists still found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by the Spaniards pervading the memories of the
natives, and at last (ch. 37) summarizing all the
grounds of his belief.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The consideration of the Polynesian route as
a possible avenue for peopling America involves
the relations of the Malays to the inhabitants
of the Oceanic Islands and the capacity of early
man to traverse long distances by water.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>E. B. Tylor has pointed out the Asiatic relations
of the Polynesians in the <i>Journal of the
Anthropological Inst.</i>, xi. 401. Pickering, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
ethnological chart accompanying the reports of
the Wilkes Expedition, makes the original people
of Chili and Peru to be Malay, and he connects
the Californians with the Polynesians.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>The earliest elaboration of this theory was in
John Dunmore Lang’s <i>View of the origin and
migrations of the Polynesian nations, demonstrating
their ancient discovery and progressive settlement
of the continent of America</i> (London,
1834; 2d ed., Sydney, 1877). /Francis A. Allen
has advanced similar views at the meetings of
the Congrès des Américanistes at Luxembourg
and at Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>The Mongol theory of the occupation of Peru,
which John Ranking so enthusiastically pressed
in his <i>Historical researches on the conquest of
Peru, Mexico, Bogota, Natchez, and Talomeco, in
the thirteenth century, by the Mongols, accompanied
with elephants; and the local agreement
of history and tradition, with the remains of
elephants and mastodontes found in the new
world</i> [etc.] (London, 1827), implies that in the
thirteenth century the Mongol emperor Kublai
Khan sent a fleet against Japan, which, being
scattered in a storm, finally in part reached the
coasts of Peru, where the son of Kublai Khan
became the first Inca.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The book hardly takes
rank as a sensible contribution to ethnology,
and Prescott says of it that it embodies “many
curious details of Oriental history and manners
in support of a whimsical theory.”<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n82" id="n82">B.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Ireland the Great, or White Man’s
Land.</span>&mdash;The claims of the Irish to have preceded
the Norse in Iceland, and to have discovered
America, rest on an Icelandic saga, which
represents that in the tenth century Are Marson,
driven off his course by a gale, found a land
which became known as Huitramannaland, or
white man’s land, or otherwise as Irland it Mikla.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
This region was supposed by the colonists
of Vinland to lie farther south, which Rafn<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> interprets
as being along the Carolina coast,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> and
others have put it elsewhere, as Beauvois in
Canada above the Great Lakes; and still others
see no more in it than the pressing of some
storm-driven vessel to the Azores<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> or some
other Atlantic island. The story is also coupled,
from another source, with the romance of Bjarni
Asbrandson, who sailed away from Iceland and
from a woman he loved, because the husband
and relatives of the woman made it desirable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
he should. Thirty years later, the crew of another
ship, wrecked on a distant coast,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> found

Irish,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> and that their chieftain was this same renegade,
who let them go apparently for the purpose
of conveying some token by which he would
be remembered to the Thurid of his dreams. Of
course all theorists who have to deal with these
supposed early discoveries by Europeans connect,
each with his own pet scheme, the prevailing
legendary belief among the American Indians
that white men at an early period made
their appearance on the coasts all the way from
Central America to Labrador.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Whether these

body of Icelandic sagas, either at first hand or
as filtered through the leading writers on Icelandic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
history, constitute the material out of
which is made up the history of Iceland, in the
days when it was sending its adventurous spirits
to Greenland and probably to the American
main.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the body of the sagas, Laing
(<i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 23) says: “It does not appear
that any saga manuscript now existing has
been written before the fourteenth century, however
old the saga itself may be. It is known
that in the twelfth century, Are Frode, Sæmund
and others began to take the sagas out of the
traditionary state and fix them in writing; but
none of the original skins appear to have come
down to our time, but only some of the numerous
copies of them.” Laing (p. 24) also instances
numerous sagas known to have existed,
but they are not now recognized;<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> and he gives
us (p. 30) the substance of what is known respecting
the writers and transcribers of this early
saga literature. It is held that by the beginning
of the thirteenth century the sagas of the discoveries
and settlements had all been put in writing,
and thus the history, as it exists, of mediæval
Iceland is, as Burton says (<i>Ultima Thule</i>, i. 237),
more complete than that of any European country.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Among the secondary writers, using either at
first or second hand the early MS. sources, the
following may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>One of the earliest brought to the attention of
the English public was <i>A Compendious Hist. of the
Goths, Swedes and Vandals, and other northern
powers</i> (London, 1650 and 1658), translated in an
abridged form from the Latin of Olaus Magnus,
which had been for more than a hundred years
the leading comprehensive authority on the
northern nations. The <i>Svearikes Historia</i> (Stockholm,
1746-62) of Olof von Dalin and the similar
work of Sven Lagerbring (1769-1788), covering
the early history of the north, are of interest
for the comparative study of the north, rather
than as elucidating the history of Iceland in
particular.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> More direct aid will be got from
Mallet’s <i>Northern Antiquities</i> (London edition,
1847) and from Wheaton’s <i>Northmen</i>. More
special is the <i>Histoire de l’Island</i> of Xavier
Marmier; and the German historian F. C. Dahlman
also touches Iceland with particular attention
in his <i>Geschichte von Dänemark bis zur
Reformation, mit Inbegriff von Norwegen und
Island</i> (Hamburg, 1840-43).</p>

<p>A history of more importance than any other
yet published, and of the widest scope, was that
of Sweden by E. J. Geijer (continued by F. F.
Carlson), which for the early period (down to
1654) is accessible in English in a translation by
J. H. Turner (London, 1845).<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Prominent among the later school of northern
historians, all touching the Icelandic annals
more or less, have been Peter Andreas Munch
in his <i>Det Norske Folks Historie</i> (Christiania,
1852-63);<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> N. M. Petersen in his <i>Danmarks
Historie i Hedenold</i> (Copenhagen, 1854-55); K.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Keyser in his <i>Norges Historie</i> (Christiania, 1866-67);
J. E. Sars in his <i>Udsigt over den Norske
Historie</i> (Christiania, 1873-77); but all are surpassed
by Konrad Maurer’s <i>Island von seiner
ersten Entdeckung bis zum Untergange des Freistaates</i>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
800-1262 (Munich, 1874), published
as commemorating the thousandth anniversary
of the settlement of Iceland, and it has
the repute of being the best book on early Icelandic
history.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>The change from Paganism to Christianity
necessarily enters into all the histories covering
the tenth and eleventh centuries; but it has
special treatment in C. Merivale’s <i>Conversion of
the Northern Nations</i> (Boyle lectures,&mdash;London,
1866).<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>There is a considerable body of the later literature
upon Iceland, retrospective in character,
and affording the results of study more or less
patient as to the life in the early Norse days in
Iceland.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>G.W. Dasent’s introduction to his <i>Story of
Burnt Njal</i> (Edinburgh, 1861)<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> and his <i>Norsemen
in Iceland</i> (Oxford Essays, 1858) give what
Max Müller (<i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>,
ii. 191) calls “a vigorous and lively sketch of
primitive northern life;” and are well supplemented
by Sabine Baring-Gould’s <i>Iceland, its
scenes and sagas</i> (London, 1863 and later), and
Richard F. Burton’s <i>Ultima Thule, with an historical
introduction</i> (London, 1875).<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n85" id="n85">D.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Greenland and its Ruins.</span>&mdash;The sagas

The earliest to use these sources in the historic
spirit was Torfæus in his <i>Historia Gronlandiæ
Antiquæ</i> (1715).<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The natural successor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Torfæus and the book upon which later writers
mostly depend is David Crantz’s <i>Historie von
Grönland, enthaltend die Beschreibung des Landes
und der Einwohner, insbesonders die Geschichten
der dortigen Mission. Nebst Fortsetzung</i> (Barby,
1765-70, 3 vols.). An English translation appeared
in London in 1767, and again, though in
an abridged form with some changes, in 1820.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p>Crantz says of his own historic aims, referring
to Torfæus and to the accounts given by the
Eskimos of the east coast, that he has tried to
investigate “where the savage inhabitants came
from, and how the ancient Norwegian inhabitants
came to be so totally extirpated,” while at
the same time he looks upon the history of the
Moravian missions as his chiefest theme.</p>

<p class="p2">The principal source for the identification of
the ruins of Greenland is the work compiled by
Rafn and Finn Magnusen, <i>Grönlands Historiske
Mindesmærker</i>,<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> with original texts and Danish
versions. Useful summaries and observations
will be found in the paper by K. Steenstrup on
“Old Scandinavian ruins in South Greenland”
in the <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i>
(Copenhagen, 1883, p. 108), and in one on “Les
Voyages des Danois au Greenland” in the same
(p. 196). Steenstrup’s paper is accompanied by
photographs and cuts, and a map marking the
site of the ruins. The latest account of them
is by Lieut. Holm in the <i>Meddelelser om Grönland</i>
(Copenhagen, 1883), vol. vi. Other views
and plans showing the arrangement of their
dwellings and the curious circular ruins,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> which
seems to have usually been near their churches,
are shown in the Baron Nordenskjöld’s <i>Den

inre isöken och dess ostkust, utförd år 1883</i> (Stockholm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
1885), the result of the ripest study and
closest contact.</p>

<p>We need also to scan the narratives of Hans
Egede and Graah. Parry found in 1824, on an
island on the Baltic coast, a runic stone, commemorating
the occupancy of the spot in 1135
(<i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>; Mallet’s <i>Northern
Antiquities</i>, 248); and in 1830 and 1831 other
runes were found on old gravestones (Rink’s
<i>Danish Greenland</i>, app. v.; Laing’s <i>Heimskringla</i>,
i. 151). These last are in the Museum
at Copenhagen. Most of these imperishable
relics have been found in the district of Julianeshaab.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n87" id="n87">E.</a></b> <span class="smcap">The Vinland Voyages.</span>&mdash;What Leif
and Karlsefne knew they experienced, and what
the sagas tell us they underwent, must have just
the difference between a crisp narrative of personal
adventure and the oft-repeated and embellished
story of a fireside narrator, since the
traditions of the Norse voyages were not put in
the shape of records till about two centuries
had elapsed, and we have no earlier manuscript
of such a record than one made nearly two hundred
years later still. It is indeed claimed that
the transmission by tradition in those days was a
different matter in respect to constancy and exactness
from what it has been known to be in
later times; but the assumption lacks proof and
militates against well-known and inevitable processes
of the human mind.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In regard to the credibility of the sagas, the
northern writers recognize the change which
came over the oral traditionary chronicles when
the romancing spirit was introduced from the
more southern countries, at a time while the
copies of the sagas which we now have were
making, after having been for so long a time
orally handed down; but they are not so successful
in making plain what influence this imported
spirit had on particular sagas, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
are asked to receive as historical records. They
seem sometimes to forget that it is not necessary
to have culture, heroes, and impossible occurrences
to constitute a myth. A blending of history
and myth prompts Horn to say “that some
of the sagas were doubtless originally based on
facts, but the telling and re-telling have changed
them into pure myths.” The unsympathetic
stranger sees this in stories that the patriotic
Scandinavians are over-anxious to make appear
as genuine chronicles.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> It is certainly unfortunate
that the period of recording the older
sagas coincides mainly with the age of this
southern romancing influence.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> It is a somewhat
anomalous condition when long-transmitted
oral stories are assigned to history, and certain
other written ones of the age of the recorded
sagas are relegated to myth. If we would believe
some of the northern writers, what appears
to be difference in kind of embellishment was
in reality the sign that separated history from
fable.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Of the interpreters of this olden lore,

exemplar, and Horn<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> says of his works

Meanwhile, Adam of Bremen, in the

prepared his <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>, an account
of the spread of Christianity in the north, in

that his subjects had found a country to the
west, called Winland.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> A reference is also supposed
to be made in the <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i> of
Ordericus Vitalis, written about the middle (say
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1140) of the twelfth century. But it was
not until somewhere between <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1385 and
1400 that the oldest Icelandic manuscript which
exists, touching the voyages, was compiled,&mdash;the
so-called <i>Codex Flatoyensis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> though how
much earlier copies of it were made is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>known. It is in this manuscript that we find the
saga of Olaf Tryggvesson,<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> wherein the voyages
of Leif Ericson are described, and it is only by
a comparison of circumstances detailed here and
in other sagas that the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1000 has been
approximately determined as the date.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> In this
same codex we find the saga of Eric the Red,
one of the chief narratives depended upon by
the advocates of the Norse discovery, and in
Rask’s judgment it “appears to be somewhat
fabulous, written long after the event, and taken
from tradition.”<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Of all the early manuscripts, the well-known
<i>Heimskringla</i> of Snorro Sturleson (b. 1178; d.
1241), purporting to be a history of the Norse
kings down to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1177, is the most entitled to
be received as an historical record, and all that
it says is in these words: “Leif also found Vinland
the Good.”<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>Saxo Grammaticus (d. about 1208) in his <i>Historia Danica</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
begins with myths, and evidently

<p>For about five hundred years after this the
stories attracted little or no attention.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> We
have seen that Peringskiöld produced these
sagas in 1697. Montanus in his <i>Nieuwe en onbekende
Weereld</i> (Amsterdam, 1671), and Campanius,
in 1702, in his <i>Kort Beskrifning om
Provincien Nya Swerige uti America</i> (Stockholm),<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
gave some details. The account which
did most, however, to revive an interest in the
subject was that of Torfæus in his <i>Historia
Vinlandiæ Antiquæ</i> (Copenhagen, 1705), but he
was quite content to place the scene of his narrative
in America, without attempting to identify
localities.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> The voyages were, a few years
later, the subject of a dissertation at the University
of Upsala in Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> J. P. Cassell, of
Bremen, discusses the Adam of Bremen story
in another Latin essay, still later.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>About 1750, Pieter Kalm, a Swede, brought
the matter to the attention of Dr. Franklin, as
the latter remembered twenty-five years later,
when he wrote to Samuel Mather that “the circumstances
gave the account a great appearance
of authenticity.”<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> In 1755, Paul Henri Mallet
(1730-1807), in his <i>Histoire de Dannemarc</i>, determines
the localities to be Labrador and
Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>In 1769, Gerhard Schöning, in his <i>Norges
Riges Historie</i>, established the scene in America.
Robertson, in 1777, briefly mentions the voyages
in his <i>Hist. of America</i> (note xvii.), and, referring
to the accounts given by Peringskiöld, calls
them rude and confused, and says that it is
impossible to identify the landfalls, though he
thinks Newfoundland may have been the scene
of Vinland. This is also the belief of J. R.
Forster in his <i>Geschichte der Entdeckungen im
Norden</i> (Frankfurt, 1784).<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> M. C. Sprengel, in
his <i>Geschichte der Europäer in Nordamerika</i>
(Leipzig, 1782), thinks they went as far south as
Carolina. Pontoppidan’s <i>History of Norway</i>
was mainly followed by Dr. Jeremy Belknap in
his <i>American Biography</i> (Boston, 1794), who
recognizes “circumstances to confirm and none
to disprove the relations.” In 1793, Muñoz, in
his <i>Historia del Nuevo Mundo</i>, put Vinland in
Greenland. In 1796 there was a brief account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in Fritsch’s <i>Disputatio historico-geographica in
qua quæritur utrum veteres Americam noverint
necne</i>. H. Stenström published at Lund, in
1801, a short dissertation, <i>De America Norvegis
ante tempora Columbi adita</i>. Boucher de la
Richarderie, in his <i>Bibliothèque Universelle des
Voyages</i> (Paris, 1808), gives a short account,
and cites some of the authorities. Some of the
earlier American histories of this century, like
Williamson’s <i>North Carolina</i>, took advantage
of the recitals of Torfæus and Mallet. Ebenezer
Henderson’s <i>Residence in Iceland</i> (1814-15)<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
presented the evidence anew. Barrow, in his
<i>Voyages to the Arctic Regions</i> (London, 1818),
places Vinland in Labrador or Newfoundland;
but J. W. Moulton, in his <i>History of the State
of New York</i> (N. Y., 1824), brings that State
within the region supposed to have been visited.</p>

<p>A writer more likely to cause a determinate
opinion in the public mind came in Washington
Irving, who in his <i>Columbus</i> (London, 1828) dismissed
the accounts as untrustworthy; though
later, under the influence of Wheaton and
Rafn, he was inclined to consider them of possible
importance; and finally in his condensed
edition he thinks the facts “established to the
conviction of most minds.”<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Hugh Murray, in
his <i>Discoveries and Travels in North America</i>
(London, 1829), regards the sagas as an authority;
but he doubts the assigning of Vinland to
America. In 1830, W. D. Cooley, in his <i>History
of Maritime and Inland Discovery</i>,<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> thought
it impossible to shake the authenticity of the
sagas.</p>

<p>While Henry Wheaton was the minister of
the United States at Copenhagen, and having
access to the collections of that city, he prepared
his <i>History of the Northmen</i>, which was
published in London and Philadelphia in 1831.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
The high character of the man gave unusual
force to his opinions, and his epitome of the
sagas in his second chapter contributed much
to increase the interest in the Northmen story.
He was the first who much impressed the New
England antiquaries with the view that Vinland
should be looked for in New England; and a
French version by Paul Guillot, issued in Paris in
1844, is stated to have been “revue et augmentée
par l’auteur, avec cartes, inscriptions, et alphabet
runique.”<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> The opinions of Wheaton,
however, had no effect upon the leading historian
of the United States, nor have any subsequent
developments caused any change in the
opinion of Bancroft, first advanced in 1834, in
the opening volume of his <i>United States</i>, where
he dismissed the sagas as “mythological in
form and obscure in meaning; ancient yet not
contemporary.” He adds that “the intrepid
mariners who colonized Greenland could easily
have extended their voyage to Labrador; but
no clear historical evidence establishes the natural
probability that they accomplished the passage.”<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
All this is omitted by Bancroft in his
last revised edition; but a paragraph in his
original third volume (1840), to the intent that,
though “Scandinavians may have reached the
shores of Labrador, the soil of the United
States has not one vestige of their presence,” is
allowed to remain,<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and is true now as when
first written.</p>

<p>The chief apostle of the Norseman belief,
however, is Carl Christian Rafn, whose work
was accomplished under the auspices of the
Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Rafn was born in 1795, and died at Copenhagen
in 1864.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> At the University, as well as
later as an officer of its library, he had bent his
attention to the early Norse manuscripts and
literature,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> so that in 1825 he was the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
founder of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries;
and much of the value of its long
series of publications is due to his active and
unflagging interest.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The summit of his American
interest, however, was reached in the great
folio <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> in which he for the
first time put the mass of original Norse documents
before the student, and with a larger accumulation
of proofs than had ever been adduced
before, he commented on the narratives and
came to conclusions respecting traces of their
occupancy to which few will adhere to-day.</p>

<p>The effect of Rafn’s volume, however, was
marked, and we see it in the numerous presentations
of the subject which followed; and every
writer since has been greatly indebted to him.</p>

<p>Alexander von Humboldt in his <i>Examen Critique</i>
(Paris, 1837) gave a synopsis of the sagas,
and believed the scene of the discoveries to be
between Newfoundland and New York; and in
his <i>Cosmos</i> (1844) he reiterated his views, holding
to “the undoubted first discovery by the
Northmen as far south as 41° 30’.”<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

          <p class="pf350">Opposite is a section of Rafn’s map in the <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>, giving his identification of the Norse
localities. This and the other map by Rafn is reproduced in his <i>Cabinet d’Antiquités Américaines</i> (Copenhagen,
1858). The map in the atlas of St. Martin’s <i>Hist. de la Géographie</i> does not track them below Newfoundland.
The map in J. T. Smith’s <i>Northmen in New England</i> (Boston, 1839) shows eleven voyages to
America from Scandinavia, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 861-1285. Cf. map in Wilhelmi’s <i>Island</i>, etc. (Heidelberg, 1842).</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Two books which for a while were the popular
treatises on the subject were the immediate
outcome of Rafn’s book. The first of these
was <i>The Northmen in New England</i>, giving the
stories in the form of a dialogue, by Joshua
Toulmin Smith (Boston, 1839), which in a
second edition (London, 1842) was called <i>The
Discovery of America by the Northmen in the
Tenth Century</i>.</p>

<p>The other book was largely an English version
of parts of Rafn’s book, translating the
chief sagas, and reproducing the maps: Nathaniel
Ludlow Beamish’s <i>Discovery of America by
the Northmen in the Tenth Century</i> (London,
1841).<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Two German books owed almost as
much to Rafn, those of K. Wilhelmi<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> and K.
H. Hermes.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Prescott, at this time publishing
the third volume of his <i>Mexico</i> (1843), accords to
Rafn the credit of taking the matter out of the
category of doubt, but he hesitates to accept
the Dane’s identifications of localities; but R.
H. Major, in considering the question in the introduction
to his <i>Select letters of Columbus</i> (1847),
finds little hesitation in accepting the views of
Rafn, and thinks “no room is left for disputing
the main fact of discovery.”</p>

<p>When Hildreth, in 1849, published his <i>United
States</i>, he ranged himself, with his distrusts, by
the side of Bancroft but J. Elliot Cabot, in making
a capital summary of the evidence in the
<i>Mass. Quarterly Review</i> (vol. ii.), accords with
the believers, but places the locality visited
about Labrador and Newfoundland. Haven in
his <i>Archæology of the United States</i> (Washington,
1856) regards the discovery as well attested,
and that the region was most likely that of Narragansett
Bay. C. W. Elliott in his <i>New England
History</i> (N. Y., 1857) holds the story to be
“in some degree mythical.” Palfrey in his <i>Hist.
of New England</i> (Boston, 1858) goes no farther
than to consider the Norse voyage as in “nowise
unlikely,” and Oscar F. Peschel in his <i>Geschichte
des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i> (Stuttgart, 1858)
is on the affirmative side. Paul K. Sinding goes
over the story with assent in his <i>History of Scandinavia</i>,&mdash;a
book not much changed in his
<i>Scandinavian Races</i> (N. Y., 1878).<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Eugène
Beauvois did little more than translate from
Rafn in his <i>Découvertes des Scandinaves en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Amérique,&mdash;fragments de Sagas Islandaises
traduits pour la première fois en français</i> (Paris,

Américaine</i> (vol. ii.).<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>Professor Daniel Wilson, of Toronto, has discussed
the subject at different times, and with
these conclusions: “With all reasonable doubts
as to the accuracy of details, there is the strongest
probability in favor of the authenticity of the
American Vinland.... The data are the mere
vague allusions of a traveller’s tale, and it is
indeed the most unsatisfactory feature of the
sagas that the later the voyages the more confused
and inconsistent their narratives become
in every point of detail.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>Dr. B. F. De Costa’s first book on the subject
was his <i>Pre-Columbian Discovery of America by
the Northmen, illustrated by Translations from
the Icelandic Sagas, edited with notes and a general
introduction</i> (Albany, 1868). It is a convenient
gathering of the essential parts of the
sagas; but the introduction rather opposes than
disproves some of the “feeble paragraphs,
pointed with a sneer,” which he charges upon
leading opponents of the faith. Professor J. L.
Diman, in the <i>North American Review</i> (July,
1869), made De Costa’s book the occasion of an
essay setting forth the grounds of a disbelief in
the historical value of the sagas. De Costa
replied in <i>Notes on a Review</i>, etc. (Charlestown,
1869). In the same year, Dr. Kohl, following
the identifications of Rafn, rehearsed the narratives
in his <i>Discovery of Maine</i> (Portland, 1869),
and tracked Karlsefne through the gulf of
Maine. De Costa took issue with him on this
latter point in his Northmen in Maine (Albany,
1870).<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> In the introduction to his <i>Sailing Directions
of Henry Hudson</i>, De Costa argues that
these mariners’ guides are the same used by the
Northmen, and in his <i>Columbus and the Geographers
of the North</i> (Hartford, 1872,&mdash;cf.
<i>Amer. Church Review</i>, xxiv. 418) he recapitulates
the sagas once more with reference to the
knowledge which he supposes Columbus to
have had of them. Paul Gaffarel, in his <i>Etudes
sur les rapports de l’Amérique et de l’ancien
Continent avant Colomb</i> (Paris, 1869), entered
more particularly into the evidence of the commerce
of Vinland and its relations to Europe.</p>

<p>Gabriel Gravier, another French author, was
rather too credulous in his <i>Découverte de l’Amérique
par les normands au X<sup>e</sup> Siècle</i> (Paris, 1874),
when he assumed with as much confidence as
Rafn ever did everything that the most ardent
advocate had sought to prove.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>There were two American writers soon to follow,
hardly less intemperate. These were Aaron
Goodrich, in <i>A History of the Character and
Achievements of the so-called Christopher Columbus</i>
(N. Y., 1874), who took the full complement
of Rafn’s belief with no hesitancy; and Rasmus
B. Anderson in his <i>America not discovered by Columbus</i>
(Chicago, 1874; improved, 1877; again
with Watson’s bibliography, 1883),<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> in which
even the Skeleton in Armor is made to play a
part. Excluding such vagaries, the book is not
without use as displaying the excessive views entertained
in some quarters on the subject. The
author is, we believe, a Scandinavian, and shows
the tendency of his race to a facility rather than
felicity in accepting evidence on this subject.</p>

<p>The narratives were first detailed among our
leading general histories when the <i>Popular
History of the United States</i> of Bryant and Gay
appeared in 1876. The claims were presented
decidedly, and in the main in the directions indicated
by Rafn; but the wildest pretensions of
that antiquary were considerately dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last score years the subject has
been often made prominent by travellers like
Kneeland<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> and Hayes,<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> who have recapitulated
the evidence; by lecturers like Charles Kingsley;<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
by monographists like Moosmüller;<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> by
the minor historians like Higginson,<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> who has
none of the fervor of the inspired identifiers of
localities, and Weise,<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> who is inclined to believe
the sea-rovers did not even pass Davis’s Straits;
and by contributors to the successive sessions
of the Congrès des Américanistes<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> and to other

<p>The question was brought to a practical issue
in Massachusetts by a proposition raised&mdash;at
first in Wisconsin&mdash;by the well-known musician
Ole Bull, to erect in Boston a statue to Leif
Ericson.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The project, though ultimately carried
out, was long delayed, and was discouraged
by members of the Massachusetts Historical
Society on the ground that no satisfactory evidence
existed to show that any spot in New
England had been reached by the Northmen.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
The sense of the society was finally expressed in
the report of their committee, Henry W. Haynes
and Abner C. Goodell, Jr., in language which
seems to be the result of the best historical criticism;
for it is not a question of the fact of discovery,
but to decide how far we can place reliance
on the details of the sagas. There is likely to remain
a difference of opinion on this point. The
committee say: “There is the same sort of reason
for believing in the existence of Leif Ericson
that there is for believing in the existence of
Agamemnon,&mdash;they are both traditions accepted
by later writers; but there is no more reason for
regarding as true the details related about his
discoveries than there is for accepting as historic
truth the narratives contained in the Homeric
poems. It is antecedently probable that
the Northmen discovered America in the early
part of the eleventh century; and this discovery
is confirmed by the same sort of historical tradition,
not strong enough to be called evidence,
upon which our belief in many of the accepted
facts of history rests.”<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>In running down the history of the literature
of the subject, the present aim has been simply
to pick out such contributions as have been in
some way significant, and reference must be made
to the bibliographies for a more perfect record.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>Irrespective of the natural probability of the
Northmen visits to the American main, other
evidence has been often adduced to support the
sagas. This proof has been linguistic, ethnological,
physical, geographical, and monumental.</p>

<p>Nothing could be slenderer than the alleged
correspondences of languages, and we can see in
Horsford’s <i>Discovery of America by Northmen</i> to
what a fanciful extent a confident enthusiasm
can carry it.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

Central America were of Scandinavian descent.
Brasseur found remnants of Norse civilization

that the Aztec civilization is Norse.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Chas.
Godfrey Leland claims that the old Norse spirit
pervades the myths and legends of the Algonkins,
and that it is impossible not to admit that
there must have been at one time “extensive intercourse
between the Northmen and the Algonkins;”
and in proof he points out resemblances
between the Eddas and the Algonkin mythology.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
It is even stated that the Micmacs have
a tradition of a people called Chenooks, who
in ships visited their coast in the tenth century.</p>

<p>The physical and geographical evidences are
held to exist in the correspondences of the coast
line to the descriptions of the sagas, including
the phenomena of the tides<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> and the length of

DeWitt Clinton and Samuel L. Mitchell
found little difficulty at one time in making
many people believe that the earthworks of
Onondaga were Scandinavian. A pretended
runic inscription on a stone said to have been
found in the Grave Creek mound was sedulously
ascribed to the Northmen.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> What some have
called a runic inscription exists on a rock near
Yarmouth in Nova Scotia, which is interpreted
“Hako’s son addressed the men,” and is supposed
to commemorate the expedition of Thorfinn
in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1007.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> A rock on the little islet
of Menana, close to Monhegan, on the coast of
Maine, and usually referred to as the Monhegan
Rock, bears certain weather marks, and there
have been those to call them runes.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> A similar

before later weathering, of different persons in discerning the same things on the rock, and in discriminating between
fissures and incisions. Col. Garrick Mallery (<i>4th Rept. Bureau of Ethnology</i>, p. 250) asserts that the
inscription has been “so manipulated that it is difficult now to determine the original details.” The drawings
represented are enumerated in the text. Later ones are numerous. Rafn also gives that of Dr. Baylies and
Mr. Gooding in 1790, and that made for the Rhode Island Hist. Society in 1830. The last has perhaps been
more commonly copied than the others. Photographs of late years are common; but almost invariably the
photographer has chalked what he deems to be the design,&mdash;in this they do not agree, of course,&mdash;in order
to make his picture clearer. I think Schoolcraft in making his daguerreotype was the first to do this. The
most careful drawing made of late years is that by Professor Seager of the Naval Academy, under the direction
of Commodore Blake; and there is in the Cabinet of the American Antiquarian Society a MS. essay
on the rock, written at Blake’s request by Chaplain Chas. R. Hale of the U. S. Navy. Haven disputes
Blake’s statement that a change in the river’s bed more nearly submerges the rock at high tide than was
formerly the case. Cf. <i>Am. Antiq. Soc.</i> Proc., Oct., 1864, p. 41, where a history of the rock is given; and in

tower now standing at Newport, R. I., as a work
of the Northmen; but the recent antiquaries
without any exception worth considering, believe
that the investigations have shown that
it was erected by Governor Arnold of Rhode
Island as a windmill, sometime between 1670
and 1680; and Palfrey in his <i>New England</i> is
thought to have put this view beyond doubt in
showing the close correspondence in design of
the tower to a mill at Chesterton, in England.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>Certain hearthstones which were discovered
over twenty-five years ago under a peat bed on
Cape Cod were held at the time to be a Norse
relic.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> In 1831 there was exhumed in Fall River,
Mass., a skeleton, which had with it what seemed
to be an ornamental belt made of metal tubes,
formed by rolling fragments of flat brass and an
oblong plate of the same metal,&mdash;not of bronze,
as is usually said,&mdash;with some arrow-heads, cut
evidently from the same material. The other
concomitants of the burial indicated an Indian
of the days since the English contact. The skeleton
attracted notice in this country by being
connected with the Norsemen in Longfellow’s
ballad, <i>The Skeleton in Armor</i>, and Dr. Webb
sent such an account of it to the Royal Society
of Northern Antiquaries that it was looked upon
as another and distinct proof of the identification
of Vinland. Later antiquaries have dismissed
all beliefs of that nature.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>There is not a single item of all the evidence
thus advanced from time to time which can be
said to connect by archæological traces the
presence of the Northmen on the soil of North
America south of Davis’ Straits. Arguments
of this kind have been abandoned except by a
few enthusiastic advocates.</p>

<p class="p2">That the Northmen voyaging to Vinland encountered
natives, and that they were called
Skraelings, may be taken as a sufficiently broad
statement in the sagas to be classed with those
concomitants of the voyages which it is reasonable
to accept. Sir William Dawson (<i>Fossil
Men</i>, 49) finds it easy to believe that these natives
were our red Indians; and Gallatin saw
no reason to dissociate the Eskimos with other
American tribes.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> That they were Eskimos
seems to be the more commonly accepted

<p>That the climate of the Atlantic coast of the
United States and the British provinces was
such as was favorable to the present Arctic
dwellers is held to be shown by such evidences
as tusks of the walrus found in phosphate beds
in South Carolina. Rude implements found in
the interglacial Jersey drift have been held by
C. C. Abbott to have been associated with a
people of the Eskimo stock, and some have
noted that palæolithic implements found in
Pennsylvania closely resemble the work of the
modern Eskimos (<i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, i. 10).<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
Dall remarks upon implements of Innuit origin
being found four hundred miles south of the
present range of the Eskimos of the northwest
coast (<i>Contributions to Amer. Ethnology</i>, i. p. 98).
Charlevoix says that Eskimos were occasionally
seen in Newfoundland in the beginning of the
last century; and ethnologists recognize to-day
the same stock in the Eskimos of Labrador and
Greenland.</p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n107" id="n107">F.</a></b> <span class="smcap">The Lost Greenland Colonies.</span>&mdash;After
intercourse with the colonies in Greenland
ceased, and definite tradition in Iceland had died
out, and when the question of the re-discovery
should arise, it was natural that attention
should first be turned to that coast of Greenland
which lay opposite Iceland as the likelier
sites of the lost colonies, and in this way we find
all the settlements placed in the maps of the
sixteenth century. The Archbishop Erik Walkendorf,
of Lund, in the early part of that century
had failed to persuade the Danish government
to send an expedition. King Frederick II
was induced, however, to send one in 1568; but
it accomplished nothing; and again in 1579 he
put another in command of an Englishman,
Jacob Allday, but the ice prevented his landing.
A Danish navigator was more successful in
1581; but the coast opposite Iceland yielded as
yet no traces of the Norse settlers. Frobisher’s
discovery of the west coast seems to have failed
of recognition among the Danes; but they with
the rest of Europe did not escape noting the importance
of the explorations of John Davis in
1585-86, through the straits which bear his name.
It now became the belief that the west settlement
must be beyond Cape Farewell. In 1605,
Christian IV of Denmark sent a new expedition
under Godske Lindenow; but there was
a Scotchman in command of one of the three
ships, and Jacob Hall, who had probably served
under Davis, went as the fleet pilot. He guided
the vessels through Davis’s Straits. But it was
rather the purpose of Lindenow to find a northwest
passage than to discover a lost colony;
and such was mainly the object which impelled
him again in 1606, and inspired Karsten Rikardsen
in 1607. Now and for some years to come
we have the records of voyages made by the
whalers to this region, and we read their narratives
in Purchas and in such collections of voyages
as those of Harris and Churchill.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> They
yield us, however, little or no help in the problem
we are discussing. In 1670 and 1671 Christian
V sent expeditions with the express purpose
of discovering the lost colonies; but Otto Axelsen,
who commanded, never returned from his
second voyage, and we have no account of his
first.</p>

<p>The mission of the priest Hans Egede gave
the first real glimmer of light.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> He was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
earliest to describe the ruins and relics observable
on the west coast, but he continued to regard
the east settlements as belonging to the
east coast, and so placed them on the map.
Anderson (Hamburg, 1746) went so far as to
place on his map the cathedral of Gardar in a
fixed location on the east coast, and his map
was variously copied in the following years.</p>

<p>In 1786 an expedition left Copenhagen to explore
the east coast for traces of the colonies,
but the ice prevented the approach to the coast,
and after attempts in that year and in 1787 the
effort was abandoned. Heinrich Peter von Eggers,
in his <i>Om Grönlands österbygds sande Beliggenhed</i>
(1792), and <i>Ueber die wahre Lage des
alten Ostgrönlands</i> (Kiel, 1794), a German translation,
first advanced the opinion that the eastern
colony as well as the western must have
been on the west coast, and his views were
generally accepted; but Wormskjöld in the
<i>Skandinavisk Litteraturselskab’s Skrifter</i>, vol. x.
(Copenhagen, 1814), still adhered to the earlier
opinions, and Saabye still believed it possible to
reach the east coast.</p>

<p>Some years later (1828-31) W. A. Graah made,
by order of the king of Denmark, a thorough
examination of the east coast, and in his <i>Undersögelses
Reise til Ostkysten af Grönland</i> (Copenhagen,
1832)<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> he was generally thought to establish
the great improbability of any traces of a
colony ever existing on that coast. Of late years
Graah’s conclusions have been questioned, for
there have been some sites of buildings discovered
on the east side.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> The Reverend J. Brodbeck,
a missionary, described some in <i>The Moravian
Quarterly</i>, July and Aug., 1882. Nordenskjöld
has held that when the east coast is explored
from 65° to 69°, there is a chance of discovering
the site of an east colony.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>R. H. Major, in a paper (<i>Journal Roy. Geog.
Soc.</i>, 1873, p. 184) on the site of the lost colony,
questioned Graah’s conclusions, and gave a
sketch map, in which he placed its site near Cape
Farewell; and he based his geographical data
largely upon the chorography of Greenland and
the sailing directions of Ivan Bardsen, who was
probably an Icelander living in Greenland some

the legends of Madoc, there are reports, which
Humboldt (<i>Cosmos</i>, Bohn, ii. 610) failed to verify,
of Welsh bards rehearsing the story before
1492,<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> and of statements in the early Welsh
annals. The original printed source is in Humfrey
Lloyd’s <i>History of Cambria, now called
Wales, written in the British language</i> [by Caradoc]

The book contained corrections and additions
by David Powell, and it was in these that the
passages of importance were found, and the
supposition was that the land visited lay near
the Gulf of Mexico. Richard Hakluyt, in his
<i>Principall Navigations</i>, took the story from
Powell, and connected the discovery with Mexico
in his edition of 1589, and with the West
Indies in that of 1600 (iii. p. 1),&mdash;and there was
not an entire absence of the suspicion that it
was worth while to establish some sort of a
British claim to antedate the Spanish one established
through Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>The linguistic evidences were not brought
into prominence till after one Morgan Jones had
fallen among the Tuscaroras<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> in 1660, and
found, as he asserted, that they could understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his Welsh. He wrote a statement of his
experience in 1685-6, which was not printed till
1740.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>During the eighteenth century we find Campanius
in his <i>Nye Swerige</i> (1702) repeating the
story; Torfæus (<i>Hist. Vinlandiæ</i>, 1705) not rejecting
it; Carte (<i>England</i>, 1747) thinking it
probable; while Campbell (<i>Admirals</i>, 1742),
Lyttleton (<i>Henry the Second</i>, 1767), and Robertson
(<i>America</i>, 1777) thought there was no
ground, at least, for connecting the story with
America.</p>

<p>It was reported that in 1764 a man, Griffeth,
was taken by the Shawnees to a tribe of Indians
who spoke Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> In 1768, Charles Beatty
published his <i>Journal of a two months’ Tour in
America</i> (London), in which he repeated information
of Indians speaking Welsh in Pennsylvania
and beyond the Mississippi, and of the
finding of a Welsh Bible among them.</p>

<p>In 1772-73, David Jones wandered among the
tribes west of the Ohio, and in 1774, at Burlington,
published his <i>Journal of two visits</i>, in which
he enumerates the correspondence of words
which he found in their tongues with his native
Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>Without noting other casual mentions, some
of which will be found in Paul Barron Watson’s
bibliography (in Anderson’s <i>America not
discovered by Columbus</i>, p. 142), it is enough
to say that towards the end of the century the
papers of John Williams<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> and George Burder<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>
gave more special examination to the subject
than had been applied before.</p>

<p>The renewed interest in the matter seems to
have prompted Southey to the writing of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
poem <i>Madoc</i>, though he refrained from publishing
it for some years. If one may judge from
his introductory note, Southey held to the historical
basis of the narrative. Meanwhile, reports
were published of this and the other tribes
being found speaking Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> In 1816, Henry
Kerr printed at Elizabethtown, New Jersey, his
<i>Travels through the Western interior of the
United States, 1808-16, with some account of a
tribe whose customs are similar to those of the
ancient Welsh</i>. In 1824, Yates and Moulton
(<i>State of New York</i>) went over the ground
rather fully, but without conviction. Hugh
Murray (<i>Travels in North America</i>, London,
1829) believes the Welsh went to Spain. In
1834, the different sides of the case were discussed
by Farcy and Warden in Dupaix’s <i>Antiquités
Méxicaines</i>. Some years later the publication
of George Catlin<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> probably gave more
conviction than had been before felt,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> arising
from his statements of positive linguistic correspondences

White<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> Mandans<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> on the Missouri River, the
similarity of their boats to the old Welsh coracles,
and other parallelisms of custom. He believed
that Madoc landed at Florida, or perhaps
passed up the Mississippi River. His conclusions
were a reinforcement of those reached by Williams.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
The opinion reached by Major in his
edition of <i>Columbus’ Letters</i> (London, 1847)
that the Welsh discovery was quite possible,
while it was by no means probable, is with little
doubt the view most generally accepted to-day;
while the most that can be made out of the
claim is presented with the latest survey in B.
F. Bowen’s <i>America discovered by the Welsh
in 1170</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> (Philad., 1876). He gathers up,
as helping his proposition, such widely scattered
evidences as the Lake Superior copper mines
and the Newport tower, both of which he appropriates;
and while following the discoverers
from New England south and west, he does not
hesitate to point out the resemblance of the
Ohio Valley mounds<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> to those depicted in Pennant’s
<i>Tour of Wales</i>; and he even is at no loss
for proofs among the relics of the Aztecs.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n111" id="n111">H.</a></b> <span class="smcap">The Zeni and their Map.</span>&mdash;Something
has been said elsewhere (Vol. III. p. 100)
of the influence of the Zeni narrative and its
map, in confusing Frobisher in his voyages.
The map was reproduced in the Ptolemy of
1561, with an account of the adventures of the
brothers, but it was so far altered as to dissever
Greenland from Norway, of which the Zeni
map had made it but an extension.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>The story got further currency in Ramusio
(1574, vol. ii.), Ortelius (1575), Hakluyt (1600,
vol. iii.), Megiser’s <i>Septentrio Novantiquus</i> (1613),
Purchas (1625), Pontanus’ <i>Rerum Danicarum</i>
(1631), Luke Fox’s <i>North-West Fox</i> (1633), and
in De Laet’s Notæ (1644), who, as well as Hornius,
<i>De Originibus Americanis</i> (1644), thinks
the story suspicious. It was repeated by Montanus
in 1671, and by Capel, <i>Vorstellungen des
Norden</i>, in 1676. Some of the features of the
map had likewise become pretty constant in the
attendant cartographical records. But from
the close of the seventeenth century for about a
hundred years, the story was for the most part
ignored, and it was not till 1784 that the interest
in it was revived by the publications of Forster<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and Buache,<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> who each expressed their belief in
the story.</p>

<p>A more important inquiry in behalf of the
narrative took place at Venice in 1808, when
Cardinal Zurla republished the map in an essay,
and marked out the track of the Zeni on a
modern chart.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>In 1810, Malte-Brun accorded his belief in
the verity of the narrative, and was inclined to
believe that the Latin books found in Estotiland
were carried there by colonists from Greenland.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
A reactionary view was taken by Biddle
in his <i>Sebastian Cabot</i>, in 1831, who believed the
publication of 1558 a fraud; but the most effective
denial of its authenticity came a few years
later in sundry essays by Zahrtmann.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>The story got a strong advocate, after nearly
forty years of comparative rest, when R. H.
Major, of the map department of the British
Museum, gave it an English dress and annexed
a commentary, all of which was published by
the Hakluyt Society in 1873. In this critic’s
view, the good parts of the map are of the fourteenth
century, gathered on the spot, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
false parts arose from the misapprehensions of
the young Zeno, who put together the book of
1558.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The method of this later Zeno was
in the same year (1873) held by Professor Konrad
Maurer to be hardly removed from a fraudulent
compilation of other existing material.
There has been a marked display of learning, of
late years, in some of the discussions.</p>

<p>Cornelio
Desimoni, the archivist of Genoa, has
printed two elaborate papers.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> The Danish
archivist Frederik Krarup published (1878) a
sceptical paper in the <i>Geografisk Tidsskrift</i> (ii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
145).<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The most exhaustive examination, however,
has come from a practical navigator, the
Baron A. E. Nordenskjöld, who in working up
the results of his own Arctic explorations was
easily led into the intricacies of the Zeno controversy.
The results which he reaches are that
the Zeni narratives are substantially true; that
there was no published material in 1558 which
could have furnished so nearly an accurate account
of the actual condition of those northern
waters; that the map which Zahrtmann saw in
the University library at Copenhagen, and
which he represented to be an original from
which the young Zeno of 1558 made his pretended
original, was in reality nothing but the
Donis map in the Ptolemy of 1482, while the Zeno
map is much more like the map of the north
made by Claudius Clavis in 1427, which was
discovered by Nordenskjöld in a codex of Ptolemy
at Nancy.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Since Nordenskjöld advanced his views there
have been two other examinations: the one by
Professor Japetus Steenstrup of Copenhagen,<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
and the other by the secretary of the Danish
Geographical Society, Professor Ed. Erslef, who
offered some new illustrations in his <i>Nye Oplysninger
om Broedrene Zenis Rejser</i> (Copenhagen,
1885).<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Among those who accept the narratives there
is no general agreement in identifying the principal
geographical points of the Zeno map. The
main dispute is upon Frislanda, the island where
the Zeni were wrecked. That it was Iceland
has been maintained by Admiral Irminger,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and
Steenstrup (who finds, however, the text not to
agree with the map), while the map accompanying
the <i>Studi biografici e bibliografici sulla storia
della geografia in Italia</i> (Rome, 1882) traces the
route of the Zeni from Iceland to Greenland,
under 70° of latitude.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Major has contended for
the Faröe islands, arguing that while the engraved
Zeno map shows a single large island, it
might have been an archipelago in the original,
with outlines run together by the obscurities of
its dilapidation, and that the Faröes by their
preserved names and by their position correspond
best with the Frislanda of the Zeni.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Major’s
views have been adopted by most later writers,
perhaps, and a similar identification had earlier
been made by Lelewel,<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Kohl,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> and others.</p>

<p>The identification of Estotiland involves the
question if the returned fisherman of the narrative
ever reached America. It is not uncommon
for even believers in the story to deny
that Estotiland and Drogeo were America.
That they were parts of the New World was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
however, the apparent belief of Mercator and of
many of the cartographers following the publication
of 1558, and of such speculators as Hugo
Grotius, but there was little common consent
in their exact position.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n115" id="n115">I.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Alleged Jewish Migration.</span>&mdash;The
identification of the native Americans with the
stock of the lost tribes of Israel very soon became
a favorite theory with the early Spanish
priests settled in America. Las Casas and
Duran adopted it, while Torquemada and
Acosta rejected it. André Thevet, of mendacious
memory, did not help the theory by espousing
it. It was approved in J. F. Lumnius’s <i>De
extremo Dei Judicio et Indorum vocatione, libri
iii.</i> (Venice and Antwerp, 1569);<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> and a century
later the belief attracted new attention in the
<i>Origen de los Americanos de Manasseh Ben Israel</i>,
published at Amsterdam in 1650.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> It was
in the same year (1650) that the question received
the first public discussion in English in
Thomas Thorowgood’s <i>Jewes in America, or,
Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race.
With the removall of some contrary reasonings,
and earnest desires for effectuall endeavours to
make them Christian</i> (London, 1650).<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Thorowgood
was answered by Sir Hamon L’Estrange
in <i>Americans no Iewes, or Improbabilities that
the Americans are of that race</i> (London, 1652).
The views of Thorowgood found sympathy with
the Apostle Eliot of Massachusetts; and when
Thorowgood replied to L’Estrange he joined
with it an essay by Eliot, and the joint work was
entitled <i>Iewes in America, or probabilities that
those Indians are Judaical, made more probable
by some additionals to the former conjectures: an
accurate discourse is premised of Mr. John Eliot
(who preached the gospel to the natives in their
own language) touching their origination, and
his Vindication of the planters</i> (London, 1660).
What seems to have been a sort of supplement,
covering, however, in part, the same ground, appeared
as <i>Vindiciæ Judæcorum, or a true account
of the Jews, being more accurately illustrated than
heretofore</i>, which includes what is called “The
learned conjectures of Rev. Mr. John Eliot” (32
pp.). Some of the leading New England divines,
like Mayhew and Mather,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> espoused the cause
with similar faith. Roger Williams also was of
the same opinion. William Penn is said to
have held like views. The belief may be said to
have been general, and had not died out in New
England when Samuel Sewall, in 1697, published
his <i>Phænomena quædam Apocalyptica ad aspectum
Novi Orbis Configurata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>After the middle of the last century we begin
to find new signs of the belief. Charles Beatty,
in his <i>Journal of a two months’ tour with a view
of promoting religion among the frontier inhabitants
of Pennsylvania</i> (Lond., 1768), finds traces
of the lost tribes among the Delawares, and repeats
a story of the Indians long ago selling the
same sacred book to the whites with which the
missionaries in the end aimed to make them acquainted.
Gerard de Brahm and Richard Peters,
both familiar with the Southern Indians, found
grounds for accepting the belief. The most
elaborate statement drawn from this region is
that of James Adair, who for forty years had
been a trader among the Southern Indians.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>

Hebrew some analogies to the native speech.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>

In 1816 Elias Boudinot, a man eminent in his
day, contributed further arguments.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Ethan

Hebrew traces which he observed in that tribe.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
Geo. Catlin, working also among the Western
Indians, while he could not go to the length of
believing in the lost tribes, was struck with the
many analogies which he saw.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> The most elaborate

<h3 class="p2"><a name="c117" id="c117">THE CARTOGRAPHY OF GREENLAND.</a></h3>

<p>The oldest map yet discovered to show any part of Greenland, and consequently of America,<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> is one found
by Baron Nordenskjöld attached to a Ptolemy Codex in the Stadtbibliothek at Nancy. He presented a colored
fac-simile of it in 1883 at the Copenhagen Congrès des Américanistes, in his little brochure <i>Trois Cartes</i>. It
was also used in illustration of his paper on the Zeni Voyages, published both in Swedish and German.
It will be seen by the fac-simile given herewith, and marked with the author’s name, Claudius Clavus, that
“Gronlandia Provincia” is an extension of a great arctic region, so as to lie over against the Scandinavian
peninsula of Europe, with “Islandia,” or Iceland, midway between the two lands. Up to the time of this
discovery by Nordenskjöld, the map generally recognized as the oldest to show Greenland is a Genovese portolano,
preserved in the Pitti Palace at Florence, about which there is some doubt as to its date, which is said
to be 1417 by Santarem (<i>Hist. de la Cartog.</i>, iii., p. xix), but Lelewel (<i>Epilogue</i>, p. 167) is held to be trustier
in giving it as 1447.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It shows how little influence the Norse stories of their Greenland colonization exerted
at this time on the cartography of the north, that few of the map-makers deemed it worth while to break the
usual terminal circle of the world by including anything west or beyond Iceland. It was, further, not easy to
convince them that Greenland, when they gave it, lay in the direction which the Sagas indicated. The map of
Fra Mauro, for instance, in 1459 cuts off a part of Iceland by its incorrigible terminal circle, as will be seen
in a bit of it given herewith, the reader remembering as he looks at it that the bottom of the segment is to the
north.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> We again owe to Nordenskjöld the discovery of another map of the north, <i>Tabula Regionum Septentrionalium</i>,
which he found in a Codex of Ptolemy in Warsaw a few years since, and which he places about
1467. The accompanying partial sketch is reproduced from a fac-simile kindly furnished by the discoverer.
The peninsula of “Gronlandia,” with its indicated glaciers, is placed with tolerable accuracy as the western
extremity of an arctic region, which to the north of Europe is separated from the Scandinavian peninsula by a
channel from the “Mare Gotticum” (Baltic Sea), which sweeps above Norway into the “Mare Congelatum.”
The confused notions arising from an attempt by the compiler of the map to harmonize different drafts is
shown by his drawing a second Greenland (“Engronelant”) to his “Norbegia,” or Norway, and placing just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
under it the “Thile”<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> of the ancients, which he makes a different island from “Islandia,” placed in proper
relations to his larger Greenland.</p>

<p>A few years later, or perhaps about the same time, and before 1471, the earliest engraved map which shows
Greenland is that of Nicolas Donis, in the Ulm edition of Ptolemy in 1482. It will be seen from the little
sketch which is annexed that the same doubling of Greenland is adhered to.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> With the usual perversion put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
upon the Norse stories, Iceland is made to lie due west of Greenland, though not shown in the present
sketch.</p>

<p>At a date not much later, say 1486, it is supposed the Laon globe, dated in 1493, was actually made, or at
least it is shown that in some parts the knowledge was rather of the earlier date, and here we have “Grolandia,”
a small island off the Norway coast.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>We have in 1489-90 a type of configuration, which later became prevalent. It is taken from an <i>Insularium
illustratum Henrici Martelli Germani</i>, a manuscript preserved in the British Museum, and shows, as seen by
the annexed extract, a long narrow peninsula, running southwest from the northern verge of Europe. A sketch
of the whole map is given elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>This seems to have been the prevailing notion of what and where Greenland was at the time of Columbus’
voyage, and it could have carried no significance to his mind that the explorations of the Norse had found the
Asiatic main, which he started to discover. How far this notion was departed from by Behaim in his globe
of 1492 depends upon the interpretation to be given to a group of islands, northwest of Iceland and northeast
of Asia, upon the larger of which he writes among its mountains, “Hi man weise Volker.”<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>As this sketch of the cartographical development goes on, it will be seen how slow the map-makers were to
perceive the real significance of the Norse discoveries, and how reluctant they were to connect them with the
discoveries that followed in the train of Columbus, though occasionally there is one who is possessed with a sort
of prevision. The Cantino map of 1502<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> does not settle the question, for a point lying northeast of the Portuguese
discoveries in the Newfoundland region only seems to be the southern extremity of Greenland. What
was apparently a working Portuguese chart of 1503 grasps pretty clearly the relations of Greenland to
Labrador.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>Lelewel (pl. 43), in a map made to show the Portuguese views at this time,<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> which he represents by combining
and reconciling the Ptolemy maps of 1511 and 1513, still places the “Gronland” peninsula in the northwest
of Europe, and if his deductions are correct, the Portuguese had as yet reached no clear conception that the
Labrador coasts upon which they fished bore any close propinquity to those which the Norse had colonized.
Ruysch, in 1508, made a bold stroke by putting “Gruenlant” down as a peninsula of Northeastern Asia,
thus trying to reconcile the discoveries of Columbus with the northern sagas.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> This view was far from acceptable.
Sylvanus, in the Ptolemy of 1511, made “Engroneland” a small protuberance on the north shore of
Scandinavia, and east of Iceland, evidently choosing between the two theories instead of accepting both, as
was common, in ignorance of their complemental relations.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Waldseemüller, in the Ptolemy of 1513, in his

<p>The great <i>Historia</i> of Olaus Magnus, as for a long time the leading authority on the northern geography,
as well as on the Scandinavian chronicles, gives us some distinct rendering of this northern geographical
problem. It was only recently that his earliest map of 1539 has been brought to light, and a section of it is
here reproduced from a much reduced fac-simile kindly sent to the editor by Dr. Oscar Brenner of the university
at Munich. Nordenskjöld, in giving a full fac-simile of the Olaus Magnus map of 1567,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> of which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fragment is herewith also given in fac-simile, says that it embodies the views of the northern geographers in
separating Greenland from Europe, which was in opposition to those of the geographers of the south of Europe,
who united Greenland to Scandinavia. Sebastian Münster in his 1540 edition of Ptolemy introduced a new confusion.
He preserved the European elongated peninsula, but called it “Islandia,” while to what stands for
Iceland is given the old classical name of Thyle.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> This confusion is repeated in his map of 1545,<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> where he
makes the coast of “Islandia” continuous with Baccalaos. This continuity of coast line seemed now to
become a common heritage of some of the map-makers,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> though in the Ulpius globe of 1542 “Groestlandia,”

<p>We have run down the main feature of the northern cartography, up to the time of the publication of the
Zeno map in 1558. The chief argument for its authenticity is that there had been nothing drawn and published
up to that time which could have conduced, without other aid, to so accurate an outline of Greenland as
it gives. In an age when drafts of maps freely circulated over Europe, from cartographer to cartographer, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>

<p>With these allowances the map does not seem to be very exceptional in
any feature. It is connected with northwestern Europe in just the manner appertaining to several of the
earlier maps. Its shape is no great improvement on the map of 1467, found at Warsaw. There was then
no such constancy in the placing of mid-sea islands in maps, to interdict the random location of other islands
at the cartographer’s will, without disturbing what at that day would have been deemed geographical probabilities,
and there was all the necessary warranty in existing maps for the most wilfully depicted archipelago.
The early Portuguese charts, not to name others, gave sufficient warrant for land where Estotiland and Drogeo
appear.</p>

in severing Greenland from Europe, when they reëngraved it.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> The same edition contained a map of “Schonlandia,”

and it was enforced by the maps of Mercator (1569 and 1587), Ortelius (1570, 1575), and Gallæus (1585),
which placed it lying mainly east and west between the Scandinavian north and the Labrador coast, which it
was now the fashion to call Estotiland. In its shape it closely resembled the Zeni outline. Another feature of
these maps was the placing of another but smaller island west of “Groenlant,” which was called “Grocland,”
and which seems to be simply a reduplication of the larger island by some geographical confusion,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> which

<p>It was just at this time (1570) that the oldest maps which display the geographical notions of the saga men
were drawn, though not brought to light for many years. We note two such of this time, and one of a date
near forty years later. One marked “Jonas, Gudmundi filius, delineavit, 1570,” is given as are the two others
by Torfæus in his <i>Gronlandia Antiqua</i>. They all seem to recognize a passage to the Arctic seas between
Norway and Greenland, the northern parts of which last are called “Risaland,” or “Riseland,” and Jonas
places “Oster Bygd” and “Wester Bygd” on the opposite sides of a squarish peninsula. Beyond what must
be Davis’ Straits is “America,” and further south “Terra Florida” and “Albania.”</p>

<p>If this description is compared with the key of Stephanius’ map, next to be mentioned, while we remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that both represent the views prevailing in the north in 1570, it is hard to resist the conclusion that Vinland
was north even of Davis’ Straits, or at least held to be so at that time.</p>

<p>The second map, that of Stephanius, is reproduced herewith, dating back to the same period (1570); but
the third, by Gudbrandus Torlacius, was made in 1606, and is sketched in Kohl’s <i>Discovery of Maine</i> (p. 109).
It gives better shape to “Gronlandia” than in either of the others.</p>

<i>Discovery of Maine</i>, p. 107, professedly after a copy given in Torfæus’ <i>Gronlandia Antiqua</i> (1706). Torfæus quotes
Theodorus Torlacius, the Icelandic historian, as saying that Stephanius appears to have drawn his map from ancient Icelandic
records. The other maps given by Torfæus are: by Bishop Gudbrand Thorlakssen (1606); by Jonas Gudmund
(1640); by Theodor Thorlakssen (1666), and by Torfæus himself. Cf. other copies of the map of Stephanius in Malte-Brun’s

<p>It is not necessary to follow the course of the Greenland cartography farther with any minuteness. As the
sixteenth century ended we have leading maps by Hakluyt in 1587 and 1599 (see Vol. III. 42), and De Bry in
1596 (Vol. IV. 99), and Wytfliet in 1597, all of which give Davis’s Straits with more or less precision. Barentz’s
map of 1598 became the exemplar of the circumpolar chart in Pontanus’ <i>Rerum et Urbis Amstelodamensium
Historia</i> of 1611.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The chart of Luke Fox, in 1635, marked progress<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> better than that of La Peyrère

“Greenland” with “Groenland.” In 1741, we have the map of Hans Egede in his “Grönland,” repeated in
late editions, and the old delineation of the east coast after Torfæus was still retained in the 1788 map of
Paul Egede.</p>

<p class="pc reduct">BY JUSTIN WINSOR.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE traditions of the migrations of the Chichimecs, Colhuas, and Nahuas,”
says Max Müller,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> “are no better than the Greek traditions
about Pelasgians, Æolians, and Ionians, and it would be a mere waste of
time to construct out of such elements a systematic history, only to be
destroyed again, sooner or later, by some Niebuhr, Grote, or Lewis.”</p>

<p>“It is yet too early,” says Bandelier,<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> “to establish a definite chronology,
running farther back from the Conquest than two centuries,<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> and even
within that period but very few dates have been satisfactorily fixed.”</p>

<p>Such are the conditions of the story which it is the purpose of this chapter
to tell.</p>

<p>We have, to begin with, as in other history, the recognition of a race
of giants, convenient to hang legends on, and accounted on all hands to have
been occupants of the country in the dimmest past, so that there is nothing
back of them. Who they were, whence they came, and what stands for
their descendants after we get down to what in this pre-Spanish history we
rather presumptuously call historic ground, is far from clear. If we had
the easy faith of the native historian Ixtlilxochitl, we should believe that
these gigantic Quinames, or Quinametin, were for the most part swallowed
up in a great convulsion of nature, and it was those who escaped which the
Olmecs and Tlascalans encountered in entering the country.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> If all this
means anything, which may well be doubted, it is as likely as not that these
giants were the followers of a demi-god, Votan,<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> who came from over-sea to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
America,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> found it peopled, established a government in Xibalba,&mdash;if such
a place ever existed,&mdash;with the germs of Maya if not of other civilizations,
whence, by migrations during succeeding times, the Votanites spread north
and occupied the Mexican plateau, where they became degenerate, doubtless,
if they deserved the extinction which we are told was in store for
them. But they had an alleged chronicler for their early days, the writer
of the Book of Votan, written either by the hero himself or by one of his
descendants,&mdash;eight or nine generations in the range of authorship making
little difference apparently. That this narrative was known to Francisco
Nuñez de la Vega<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> would seem to imply that somebody at that time
had turned it into readable script out of the unreadable hieroglyphics, while
the disguises of the Spanish tongue, perhaps, as Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> suggests, may
have saved it from the iconoclastic zeal of the priests. When, later, Ramon
de Ordoñez had the document,&mdash;perhaps the identical manuscript,&mdash;it consisted
of a few folios of quarto paper, and was written in Roman script in
the Tzendal tongue, and was inspected by Cabrera, who tells us something
of its purport in his <i>Teatro critico Americano</i>, while Ramon himself was at
the same time using it in his <i>Historia del Cielo y de la Tierra</i>. It was from
a later copy of this last essay, the first copy being unknown, that the Abbé
Brasseur de Bourbourg got his knowledge of what Ramon had derived from
the Votan narrative, and which Brasseur has given us in several of his
books.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> That there was a primitive empire&mdash;Votanic, if you please&mdash;seems
to some minds confirmed by other evidences than the story of Votan;
and out of this empire&mdash;to adopt a European nomenclature&mdash;have come,
as such believers say, after its downfall somewhere near the Christian era,
and by divergence, the great stocks of people called Maya, Quiché, and
Nahua, inhabiting later, and respectively, Yucatan, Guatemala, and Mexico.
This is the view, if we accept the theory which Bancroft has prominently
advocated, that the migrations of the Nahuas were from the south
northward,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> and that this was the period of the divergence, eighteen centuries
ago or more, of the great civilizing stocks of Mexico and of Central
America.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> We fail to find so early a contact of these two races, if, on the
other hand, we accept the old theory that the migrations which established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the Toltec and Aztec powers were from the north southward,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> through
three several lines, as is sometimes held, one on each side of the Rocky
Mountains, with a third following the coast. In this way such advocates
trace the course of the Olmecs, who encountered the giants, and later of the
Toltecs.</p>

<p>That the Votanic peoples or some other ancient tribes were then a distinct
source of civilization, and that Palenqué may even be Xibalba, or the
Nachan, which Votan founded, is a belief that some archæologists find
the evidence of in certain radical differences in the Maya tongues and in
the Maya ruins.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>In the Quiché traditions, as preserved in the <i>Popul Vuh</i>, and in the
<i>Annals of the Cakchiquels</i>, we likewise go back into mistiness and into the
inevitable myths which give the modern comparative mythologists so much
comfort and enlightenment; but Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> and the rest get from all this
nebulousness, as was gotten from the Maya traditions, that there was a
great power at Xibalba,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>&mdash;if in Central America anywhere that place may
have been,&mdash;which was overcome<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> when from Tulan<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> went out migrating
chiefs, who founded the Quiché-Cakchiquel peoples of Guatemala, while
others, the Yaqui,&mdash;very likely only traders,&mdash;went to Mexico, and still
others went to Yucatan, thus accounting for the subsequent great centres
of aboriginal power&mdash;if we accept this view.</p>

<p>As respects the traditions of the more northern races, there is the same
choice of belief and alternative demonstration. The Olmecs, the earliest
Nahua corners, are sometimes spoken of as sailing from Florida and landing
on the coast at what is now Pánuco, whence they travelled to Guatemala,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>
and finally settled in Tamoanchan, and offered their sacrifices farther
north at Teotihuacan.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> This is very likely the Votan legend suited to the
more northern region, and if so, it serves to show, unless we discard the
whole theory, how the Votanic people had scattered. The other principal
source of our suppositions&mdash;for we can hardly call it knowledge&mdash;of these
times is the <i>Codex Chimalpòpoca</i>, of which there is elsewhere an account,<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and from it we can derive much the same impressions, if we are disposed to
sustain a preconceived notion.</p>

<p>The periods and succession of the races whose annals make up the history
of what we now call Mexico, prior to the coming of the Spaniards, are
confused and debatable. Whether under the name of Chichimecs we are to
understand a distinct people, or a varied and conglomerate mass of people,
which, in a generic way, we might call barbarians, is a question open to
discussion.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> There is no lack of names<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> to be applied to the tribes and
bands which, according to all accounts, occupied the Mexican territory previous
to the sixth century. Some of them were very likely Nahua forerunners<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
of the subsequent great influx of that race, like the Olmecs and
Xicalancas, and may have been the people, “from the direction of Florida,”
of whom mention has been made. Others, as some say, were eddies of those
populous waves which, coming by the north from Asia, overflowed the
Rocky Mountains, and became the builders of mounds and the later peoples
of the Mississippi Valley,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> passed down the trend of the Rocky Mountains,
and built cliff-houses and pueblos, or streamed into the table-land of Mexico.
This is all conjecture, perhaps delusion, but may be as good a supposition
as any, if we agree to the northern theory, as Nadaillac<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> does, but not
so tenable, if, with the contrary Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> we hold rather that they came
from the south. We can turn from one to the other of these theorists and
agree with both, as they cite their evidences. On the whole, a double compliance
is better than dogmatism. It is one thing to lose one’s way in this
labyrinth of belief, and another to lose one’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the Olmecs who found the Quinames, or giants, near Puebla and
Cholula, and in the end overcame them. The Olmecs built, according to
one story, the great pyramid of Cholula,<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and it was they who received
the great Quetzalcoatl from across the sea, a white-bearded man, as the
legends went, who was benign enough, in the stories told of him, to make
the later Spaniards think, when they heard them, that he was no other than
the Christian St. Thomas on his missions. When the Spaniards finally induced
the inheritors of the Olmecs’ power to worship Quetzalcoatl as a
beneficent god, his temple soon topped the mound at Cholula.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> We have
seen that the great Nahua occupation of the Mexican plateau, at a period
somewhere from the fourth to the seventh century,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> was preceded by
some scattered tribal organizations of the same stock, which had at an
early date mingled with the primitive peoples of this region. We have
seen that there is a diversity of opinion as to the country from which they
came, whether from the north or south. A consideration of this question
involves the whole question of the migration of races in these pre-Columbian
days, since it is the coming and going of peoples that form the basis
of all its history.</p>

<p>In the study of these migrations, we find no more unanimity of interpretation
than in other questions of these early times.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> The Nahua peoples
(Toltecs, Aztecs, Mexicans, or what you will), according to the prevalent
views of the early Spanish writers, came by successive influxes from the
north or northwest, and from a remote place called Tollan, Tula, Tlapallan,
Huehue-Tlapallan, as respects the Toltec group,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> and called Aztlan as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
respects the Aztec or Mexican. When, by settlement after settlement, each
migratory people pushed farther south, they finally reached Central Mexico.
This sequence of immigration seems to be agreed upon, but as to where
their cradle was and as to what direction their line of progress took, there
is a diversity of opinion as widely separated as the north is from the south.
The northern position and the southern direction is all but universally
accepted among the early Spanish writers<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> and their followers,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> while it is
claimed by others that the traditions as preserved point to the south
as the starting-point. Cabrera took this view. Brasseur sought to reconcile
conflicting tradition and Spanish statement by carrying the line of
migration from the south with a northerly sweep, so that in the end Anahuac
would be entered from the north, with which theory Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> is
inclined to agree. Aztlan, as well as Huehue-Tlapallan, by those who
support the northern theory, has been placed anywhere from the California
peninsula<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> within a radius that sweeps through Wisconsin and strikes
the Atlantic at Florida.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The advocates of the southern starting-point of these migrations have
been comparatively few and of recent prominence; chief among them are
Squier and Bancroft.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p class="p2">With the appearance of a people, which, for want of a better designation,
are usually termed Toltecs, on the Mexican table-land in the sixth century
or thereabouts,<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> we begin the early history of Mexico, so far as we can make
any deductions from the semi-mythical records and traditions which the
Spaniards or the later aborigines have preserved for us. This story of the
Nahua occupation of Anáhuac is one of strife and shifting vassalage, with
rivalries and uprisings of neighboring and kindred tribes, going on for centuries.
While the more advanced portion of the Nahuas in Anáhuac were
making progress in the arts, that division of the same stock which was
living beyond such influence, and without the bounds of Anáhuac, were
looked upon rather as barbarians than as brothers, and acquired the name
which had become a general one for such rougher natures, Chichimec.
It is this Chichimec people under some name or other who are always
starting up and overturning something. At one time they unite with the
Colhuas and found Colhuacan, and nearly subjugate the lake region. Then
the Toltec tarriers at Huehue-Tlapallan come boldly to the neighborhood
of the Chichimecs and found Tollan; and thus they turn a wandering community
into what, for want of a better name, is called a monarchy. They
strengthened its government by an alliance with the Chichimecs,<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> and
placed their seat of power at Colhuacan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we read of a power springing up at Tezcuco, and of various other
events, which happened or did not happen, according as you believe this or
the other chronicle. The run of many of the stories of course produces
the inevitable and beautiful daughter, and the bold princess, who control
many an event. Then there is a league of Colhuacan, Otompan, and Tollan.
Suddenly appears the great king Quetzalcoatl,&mdash;though it may be we confound
him with the divinity of that name; and with him, to perplex matters,
comes his sworn enemy Huemac. Quetzalcoatl’s devoted labors to
make his people give up human sacrifice arrayed the priesthood against
him, until at last he fell before the intrigues that made Huemac succeed in
Tollan, and that drove his luckless rival to Cholula, where he reigned anew.
Huemac followed him and drove him farther; but in doing so he gave his
enemies in Tollan a chance to put another on the throne.</p>

<p>Then came a season of peace and development, when Tollan grew
splendid. Colhuacan flourished in political power, and Teotihuacan<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> and
Cholula were the religious shrines of the people. But at last the end was
near.</p>

<p>The closing century of the Toltec power was a frightful one for broil,
pestilence, and famine among the people, amours and revenge in the great
chieftain’s household, revolt among the vassals; with sorcery rampant
and the gods angry; with volcanoes belching, summers like a furnace, and
winters like the pole; with the dreaded omen of a rabbit, horned like a deer,
confronting the ruler, while rebel forces threatened the capital. There
was also civil strife within the gates, phallic worship and debauchery,&mdash;all
preceding an inundation of Chichimecan hordes. Thus the power that
had flourished for several hundred years fell,&mdash;seemingly in the latter half
of the eleventh century.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> The remnant that was left of the desolated
people went hither and thither, till the fragments were absorbed in the
conquerors, or migrated to distant regions south.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>Whether the term Toltec signified a nation, or only denoted a dynasty,
is a question for the archæologists to determine. The general opinion
heretofore has been that they were a distinct race, of the Nahua stock, however,
and that they came from the north. The story which has been thus
far told of their history is the narrative of Ixtlilxochitl, and is repeated
by Veytia, Clavigero, Prescott, Brasseur de Bourbourg, Orozco y Berra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Nadaillac, and the later compilers. Sahagún seems to have been the first
to make a distinct use of the name Toltec, and Charency in his paper on
<i>Xibalba</i> finds evidence that the Toltecs constituted two different migrations,
the one of a race that was straight-headed, which came from the
northwest, and the other of a flat-headed people, which came from Florida.</p>

<p>Brinton, on the contrary, finds no warrant either for this dual migration,
or indeed for considering the Toltecs to be other than a section of the
same race, that we know later as Aztecs or Mexicans. This sweeping
denial of their ethnical independence had been forestalled by Gallatin;<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
but no one before Brinton had made it a distinct issue, though some
writers before and since have verged on his views.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> Others, like Charnay,
have answered Brinton’s arguments, and defended the older views.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Bandelier’s
views connect them with the Maya rather than with the Nahua
stock,<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> if, as he thinks may be the case, they were the people who landed
at Pánuco and settled at Tamoanchan, the Votanites, as they are sometimes
called. He traces back to Herrera and Torquemada the identification for
the first time of the Toltecs with these people.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> Bandelier’s conclusions,
however, are that “all we can gather about them with safety is, that they
were a sedentary Indian stock, which at some remote period settled in Central
Mexico,” and that “nothing certain is known of their language.”<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The desolation of Anáhuac as the Toltecs fell invited a foreign occupation,
and a remote people called Chichimecs<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>&mdash;not to be confounded with the
primitive barbarians which are often so called&mdash;poured down upon the country.
Just how long after the Toltec downfall this happened, is in dispute;<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>
but within a few years evidently, perhaps within not many months, came
the rush of millions, if we may believe the big stories of the migration.
They surged by the ruined capital of the Toltecs, came to the lake, founded
Xoloc and Tenayocan, and encountered, as they spread over the country,
what were left of the Toltecs, who secured peace by becoming vassals. Not
quite so humble were the Colhuas of Colhuacan,&mdash;not to be confounded
with the Acolhuas,&mdash;who were the most powerful section of the Toltecs
yet left, and the Chichimecs set about crushing them, and succeeded in
making them also vassals.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> The Chichimec monarchs, if that term does
not misrepresent them, soon formed alliances with the Tepanecs, the Otomis,
and the Acolhuas, who had been prominent in the overthrow of the
Toltecs, and all the invaders profited by the higher organizations and arts
which these tribes had preserved and now imparted. The Chichimecs also
sought to increase the stability of their power by marriages with the noble
Toltecs still remaining. But all was not peace. There were rebellions
from time to time to be put down; and a new people, whose future they did
not then apprehend, had come in among them and settled at Chapultepec.
These were the Aztecs, or Mexicans, a part of the great Nahua immigration,
but as a tribe they had dallied behind the others on the way, but were
now come, and the last to come.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>Tezcuco soon grew into prominence as a vassal power,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> and upon the capital
city many embellishments were bestowed, so that the great lord of the
Chichimecs preferred it to his own Tenayocan, which gave opportunity for
rebellious plots to be formed in his proper capital; and here at Tezcuco
the next succeeding ruler preferred to reign, and here he became isolated
by the uprising of rebellious nobles. The ensuing war was not simply of
side against side, but counter-revolutions led to a confusion of tumults, and
petty chieftains set themselves up against others here and there. The
result was that Quinantzin, who had lost the general headship of the country,
recovered it, and finally consolidated his power to a degree surpassing
all his predecessors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Aztecs at Chapultepec, growing arrogant, provoked their
neighbors, and were repressed by those who were more powerful. But they
abided their time. They were good fighters, and the Colhua ruler courted
them to assist him in his maraudings, and thus they were becoming accustomed
to warfare and to conquest, and were giving favors to be repaid. This
intercourse, whether of association or rivalry, of the Colhuas and Mexicans
(Aztecs), was continued through succeeding periods, with a confusion of
dates and events which it is hard to make clear. There was mutual distrust
and confidence alternately, and it all ended in the Aztecs settling on an
island in the lake, where later they founded Tenochtitlan, or Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>

<p>Meanwhile the powers at Colhuacan and Azcapuzalco flourished and
repressed uprisings, and out of all the strife Tezozomoc came into prominence
with his Tepanecs, and amid it all the Aztecs, siding here and there,
gained territory. With all this occurring in different parts of his dominions,
the Chichimec potentate grew stronger and stronger, and while by his
countenance the old Toltec influences more and more predominated. And
so it was a flourishing government, with little to mar its prospects but the
ambition of Tezozomoc, the Tepanec chieftain, and the rising power of the
Aztecs, who had now become divided into Mexicans and Tlatelulcas. The
famous ruler of the Chichimecs, Techotl, died in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1357, and the young
Ixtlilxochitl took his power with all its emblems. The people of Tenochtitlan,
or their rulers, were adepts in practising those arts of diplomacy by
which an ambitious nation places itself beside its superiors to secure a sort
of reflected consequence. Thus they pursued matrimonial alliances and
other acts of prudence. Both Tenochtitlan and its neighbor Tlatelulco grew
apace, while skilled artisans and commercial industries helped to raise them
in importance.</p>

<p>The young Ixtlilxochitl at Tezcuco was not so fortunate, and it soon
looked as if the Tepanec prince, Tezozomoc, was only waiting an opportunity
to rebel. It was also pretty clear that he would have the aid of Mexico
and Tlatelulco, and that he would succeed in securing the sympathy of many
wavering vassals or allies. The plans of the Tepanec chieftain at last
ripened, and he invaded the Tezcucan territory in 1415. In the war which
followed, Ixtlilxochitl reversed the tide and invaded the Tepanec territory,
besieging and capturing its capital, Azcapuzalco.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> The conqueror lost by
his clemency what he had gained by arms, and it was not long before he
was in turn shut up in his own capital. He did not succeed in defending it,
and was at last killed. So Tezozomoc reached his vantage of ambition, and
was now in his old age the lord paramount of the country. He tried to
harmonize the varied elements of his people; but the Mexicans had not
fared in the general successes as they had hoped for, and were only openly
content. The death of Tezozomoc prepared the way for one of his sons,
Maxtla, to seize the command, and the vassal lords soon found that the
spirit which had murdered a brother had aims that threatened wider desolation.
The Mexicans were the particular object of Maxtla’s oppressive
spirit, and by the choice of Itzcoatl for their ruler, who had been for many
years the Mexican war-chief, that people defied the lord of all, and in this
they were joined by the Tlatelulcas under Quauhtlatohuatzin, and by lesser
allies. Under this combination of his enemies Maxtla’s capital fell, the
usurper was sacrificed, and the honors of the victory were shared by Itzcoatl,
Nezahualcoyotl (the Acolhuan prince whose imperial rights Maxtla
had usurped), and Montezuma, the first of the name,&mdash;all who had in their
several capacities led the army of three or four hundred thousand allies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
if we may believe the figures, to their successes, which occurred apparently
somewhere between 1425 and 1430. The political result was a tripartite
confederacy in Anáhuac, consisting of Acolhua, Mexico, and Tlacopan. In
the division of spoils, the latter was to have one fifth, and the others two
fifths each, the Acolhuan prince presiding in their councils as senior.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>The next hundred years is a record of the increasing power of this confederacy,
with a constant tendency to give Mexico a larger influence.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> The
two capitals, Tenochtitlan and Tezcuco, looking at each other across the
lake, were uninterruptedly growing in splendor, or in what the historians call
by that word,<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> with all the adjuncts of public works,&mdash;causeways, canals,
aqueducts, temples, palaces and gardens, and other evidences of wealth,
which perhaps these modern terms only approximately represent. Tezcuco
was taken possession of by Nezahualcoyotl as his ancient inheritance, and
his confederate Itzcoatl placed the crown on his head. Together they made
war north and south. Xochimilco, on the lake next south of Mexico,
yielded; and the people of Chalco, which was on the most southern of the
string of lakes, revolted and were suppressed more than once, as opportunities
offered. The confederates crossed the ridge that formed the southern
bound of the Mexican valley and sacked Quauhnahuac. The Mexican ruler
had in all this gained a certain ascendency in the valley coalition, when he
died in 1440, and his nephew, Montezuma the soldier, and first of the name,<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
succeeded him. This prince soon had on his hands another war with Chalco,
and with the aid of his confederates he finally humbled its presumptuous
people. So, with or without pretence, the wars and conquests went on, if
for no other reasons, to obtain prisoners for sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> They were diversified
at times, particularly in 1449, by contests with the powers of nature,
when the rising waters of the lake threatened to drown their cities, and
when, one evil being cured, others in the shape of famine and plague succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes in the wars the confederates over-calculated their own prowess,
as when Atonaltzin of Tilantongo sent them reeling back, only, however, to
make better preparations and to succeed at last. In another war to the
southeast they captured, as the accounts say, over six thousand victims for
the stone of sacrifice.</p>

<p>The first Montezuma died in 1469, and the choice for succession fell on
his grandson, the commander of the Mexican army, Axayacatl, who at once
followed the usual custom of raiding the country to the south to get the
thousands of prisoners whose sacrifice should grace his coronation. Nezahualcoyotl,
the other principal allied chieftain, survived his associate but
two years, dying in 1472, leaving among his hundred children but one legitimate
son, Nezahualpilli, a minor, who succeeded. This gave the new Mexican
ruler the opportunity to increase his power. He made Tlatelulco
tributary, and a Mexican governor took the place there of an independent
sovereign. He annexed the Matlaltzinca provinces on the west. So Axayacatl,
dying in 1481, bequeathed an enlarged kingdom to his brother and
successor, Tizoc, who has not left so warlike a record. According to some
authorities, however, he is to be credited with the completion of the great
Mexican temple of Huitzilopochtli. This did not save him from assassination,
and his brother Ahuitzotl in 1486 succeeded, and to him fell the lot
of dedicating that great temple. He conducted fresh wars vigorously
enough to be able within a year, if we may believe the native records, to
secure sixty or seventy thousand captives for the sacrificial stone, so essential
a part of all such dedicatory exercises. It would be tedious to enumerate
all the succeeding conquests, though varied by some defeats, like that
which they experienced in the Tehuantepec region. Some differences grew
up, too, between the Mexican chieftain and Nezahualpilli, notwithstanding
or because of the virtues of the latter, among which doubtless, according to
the prevailing standard, we must count his taking at once three Mexican
princesses for wives, and his keeping a harem of over two thousand women,
if we may believe his descendant, the historian Ixtlilxochitl. His justice
as an arbitrary monarch is mentioned as exemplary, and his putting to death
a guilty son is recounted as proof of it.</p>

<p>Ahuitzotl had not as many virtues, or perhaps he had not a descendant to
record them so effectively; but when he died in 1503, what there was heroic
in his nature was commemorated in his likeness sculptured with others
of his line on the cliff of Chapultepec.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> To him succeeded that Montezuma,
son of Axayacatl, with whom later this ancient history vanishes.
When he came to power, the Aztec name was never significant of more
lordly power, though the confederates had already had some reminders that
conquest near home was easier than conquest far away. The policy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
last Aztec ruler was far from popular, and while he propitiated the higher
ranks, he estranged the people. The hopes of the disaffected within and
without Anáhuac were now centred in the Tlascalans, whose territory lay
easterly towards the Gulf of Mexico, and who had thus far not felt the burden
of Aztec oppression. Notwithstanding that their natural allies, the Cholulans,
turned against the Tlascalans, the Aztec armies never succeeded in
humbling them, as they did the Mistecs and the occupants of the region
towards the Pacific. Eclipses, earthquakes, and famine soon succeeded one
another, and the forebodings grew numerous. Hardly anything happened
but the omens of disaster<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> were seen in it, and superstition began to do its
work of enervation, while a breach between Montezuma and the Tezcucan
chief was a bad augury. In this condition of things the Mexican king tried
to buoy his hopes by further conquests; but widespread as these invasions
were, Michoacan to the west, and Tlascala to the east, always kept their
independence. The Zapotecs in Oajaca had at one time succumbed, but
this was before the days of the last Montezuma.</p>

<p>His rival across the lake at Tezcuco was more oppressed with the tales of
the soothsayers than Montezuma was, and seems to have become inert before
what he thought an impending doom some time before he died, or, as
his people believed, before he had been translated to the ancient Amaquemecan,
the cradle of his race. This was in 1515. His son Cacama was
chosen to succeed; but a younger brother, Ixtlilxochitl, believed that the
choice was instigated by Montezuma for ulterior gain, and so began a revolt
in the outlying provinces, in which he received the aid of Tlascala. The
appearance of the Spaniards on the coasts of Yucatan and Tabasco, of which
exaggerated reports reached the Mexican capital, paralyzed Montezuma, so
that the northern revolt succeeded, and Cacama and Ixtlilxochitl came to an
understanding, which left the Mexicans without much exterior support.
Montezuma was in this crippled condition when his lookouts on the coast
sent him word that the dreaded Spaniards had appeared, and he could recognize
their wonderful power in the pictured records which the messenger
bore to him.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> This portent was the visit in 1518 of Juan de Grijalva to the
spot where Vera Cruz now stands; and after the Spaniard sailed away, there
were months of anxiety before word again reached the capital, in 1519, of
another arrival of the white-winged vessels, and this was the coming of Cortés,
who was not long in discovering that the path of his conquest was made
clear by the current belief that he was the returned Quetzalcoatl,<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his quick perception of the opportunity which presented itself of combining
and leading the enemies of Montezuma.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Among what are usually reckoned the civilized nations of middle America,
there are two considerable centres of a dim history that have little
relation with the story which has been thus far followed. One of these is
that of the people of what we now call Guatemala, and the other that of
Yucatan. The political society which existed in Guatemala had nothing of
the known duration assigned to the more northern people, at least not in
essential data; but we know of it simply as a very meagre and perplexing
chronology running for the most part back two or three centuries only.
Whether the beginnings of what we suppose we know of these people have
anything to do with any Toltec migration southward is what archæologists
dispute about, and the philologists seem to have the best of the argument
in the proof that the tongue of these southern peoples is more like Maya
than Nahua. It is claimed that the architectural remains of Guatemala indicate
a departure from the Maya stock and some alliance with a foreign
stock; and that this alien influence was Nahuan seems probable enough
when we consider certain similarities in myth and tradition of the Nahuas
and the Quichés. But we have not much even of tradition and myth of
the early days, except what we my read in the <i>Popul Vuh</i>, where we may
make out of it what we can, or even what we please,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> with some mysterious
connection with Votan and Xibalba. Among the mythical traditions of
this mythical period, there are the inevitable migration stories, beginning
with the Quichés and ending with the coming of the Cakchiquels, but no
one knows to a surety when. The new-comers found Maya-speaking people,
and called them mem or memes (stutterers), because they spoke the
Maya so differently from themselves.</p>

<p>It was in the twelfth or thirteenth century that we get the first traces of
any historical kind of the Quichés and of their rivals the Cakchiquels. Of
their early rulers we have the customary diversities and inconsistencies
in what purports to be their story, and it is difficult to say whether this or
the other or some other tribe revolted, conquered, or were beaten, as we read
the annals of this constant warfare. We meet something tangible, however,
when we learn that Montezuma sent a messenger, who informed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Quichés of the presence of the Spaniards in his capital, which set them
astir to be prepared in their turn.</p>

<p>It is in the beginning of the sixteenth century that we encounter the
rivalries of three prominent peoples in this Guatemala country, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
were the Quichés, the Cakchiquels, and the Zutigils; and of these the Quichés,
with their main seat at Utatlan, were the most powerful, though not
so much so but the Cakchiquels could get the best of them at times in the
wager of war; as they did also finally when the Spaniard Alvarado appeared,
with whom the Cakchiquels entered into an alliance that brought
the Quichés into sore straits.</p>

<p class="p2">A more important nationality attracts us in the Mayas of Yucatan. There
can be nothing but vague surmise as to what were the primitive inhabitants
of this region; but it seems to be tolerably clear that a certain homogeneousness
pervaded the people, speaking one tongue, which the Spaniards
found in possession. Whether these had come from the northern regions,
and were migrated Toltecs, as some believe, is open to discussion.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> It has
often been contended that they were originally of the Nahua and Toltec
blood; but later writers, like Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> have denied it. Brinton discards
the Toltec element entirely.</p>

<p>What by a license one may call history begins back with the semi-mythical
Zamná, to whom all good things are ascribed&mdash;the introduction of the
Maya institutions and of the Maya hieroglyphics.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> Whether Zamná had
any connection, shadowy or real, with the great Votanic demi-god, and with
the establishment of the Xibalban empire, if it may be so called, is a thing
to be asserted or denied, as one inclines to separate or unite the traditions
of Yucatan with those of the Tzendal, Quiché, and Toltec. Ramon de Ordonez,
in a spirit of vagary, tells us that Mayapan, the great city of the
early Mayas, was but one of the group of centres, with Palenqué, Tulan,
and Copan for the rest, as is believed, which made up the Votanic empire.
Perhaps it was. If we accept Brinton’s view, it certainly was not. Then
Torquemada and Landa tell us that Cukulcan, a great captain and a god,
was but another Quetzalcoatl, or Gucumatz. Perhaps he was. Possibly
also he was the bringer of Nahua influence to Mayapan, away back in a
period corresponding to the early centuries of the Christian era. It is easy
to say, in all this confusion, this is proved and that is not. The historian,
accustomed to deal with palpable evidence, feels much inclined to leave all
views in abeyance.</p>

<p>The Cocomes of Yucatan history were Cukulcan’s descendants or followers,
and had a prosperous history, as we are told; and there came to live
among them the Totul Xius, by some considered a Maya people, who like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the Quichés had been subjected to Nahua influences, and who implanted
in the monuments and institutions of Yucatan those traces of Nahua character
which the archæologists discover.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> The Totul Xius are placed in
Uxmal in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, where they flourished
along with the Cocomes, and it is to them that it is claimed many of the
ruins which now interest us in Yucatan can be traced, though some of them
perhaps go back to Zamná and to the Xibalban period, or at least it would
be hard to prove otherwise.</p>

<p>When at last the Cocome chieftains began to oppress their subjects, the
Totul Xius gave them shelter, and finally assisted them in a revolt, which
succeeded and made Uxmal the supreme city, and Mayapan became a ruin,
or at least was much neglected. The dynasty of the Totul Xius then flourished,
but was in its turn overthrown, and a period of factions and revolutions
followed, during which Mayapan was wholly obliterated, and the Totul
Xius settled in Mani, where the Spaniards found them when they invaded
Yucatan to make an easy conquest of a divided people.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>We cannot neglect for this ancient period the more general writers on New Spain,
some of whom lived near enough to the Conquest to reflect current opinions upon the aboriginal
life as it existed in the years next succeeding the fall of Mexico. Such are Peter
Martyr, Grynæus, Münster, and Ramusio. More in the nature of chronicles is the <i>Historia

Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i>, ii. 387) says of the ancient history of Mexico that “it
appears as if the twelfth century was the limit of definite tradition. What lies beyond it
is vague and uncertain, remnants of tradition being intermingled with legends and mythological
fancies.” He cites some of the leading writers as mainly starting in their stories
respectively as follows: Brasseur, <span class="smcap">B. C</span>. 955; Clavigero, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 596; Veytia, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 697; Ixtlilxochitl,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 503. Bandelier views all these dates as too mythical for historical investigations,
and finds no earlier fixed date than the founding of Tenochtitlan (Mexico) in
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1325. “What lies beyond the twelfth century can occasionally be rendered of value
for ethnological purposes, but it admits of no definite historical use.” Bancroft (v. 360)
speaks of the sources of disagreement in the final century of the native annals, from the
constant tendency of such writers as Ixtlilxochitl, Tezozomoc, Chimalpain, and Camargo,
to laud their own people and defame their rivals.</p>

<p class="p2">In the latter part of the sixteenth century the viceroy of Mexico, Don Martin Enriquez,
set on foot some measures to gather the relics and traditions of the native Mexicans.
Under this incentive it fell to Juan de Tobar, a Jesuit, and to Diego Duran, a Dominican,
to be early associated with the resuscitation of the ancient history of the country.</p>

<p>To Father Tobar (or Tovar) we owe what is known as the <i>Codex Ramirez</i>, which in the
edition of the <i>Crónica Mexicana</i><a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> by Hernando de Alvarado Tezozomoc, issued in Mexico
(1878), with annotations by Orozco y Berra, is called a <i>Relacion del origen de los Indios
que habitan esta nueva España segun sus historias</i> (José M. Vigil, editor). It is an important
source of our knowledge of the ancient history of Mexico, as authoritatively interpreted
by the Aztec priests, from their picture-writings, at the bidding of Ramirez de Fuenleal,
Bishop of Cuenca. This ecclesiastic carried the document with him to Spain, where
in Madrid it is still preserved. It was used by Herrera. Chavero and Brinton recognize
its representative value.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>To Father Duran we are indebted for an equally ardent advocacy of the rights of the
natives in his <i>Historia de las Indias de Nueva-España y islas de Tierra-Firme</i> (1579-81),
which was edited in part (1867), as stated elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> by José F. Ramirez, and after
an interval completed (1880) by Prof. Gumesindo Mendoza, of the Museo Nacional,&mdash;the
perfected work making two volumes of text and an atlas of plates. Both from Tobar
and from Duran some of the contemporary writers gathered largely their material.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>We come to a different kind of record when we deal with the Roman script of the early
phonetic rendering of the native tongues. It has been pointed out that we have perhaps
the earliest of such renderings
in a single sentence in a publication
made at Antwerp in 1534,
where a Franciscan, Pedro de
Gante,<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> under date of June 21,
1529, tells the story of his arriving
in America in 1523, and his
spending the interval in Mexico
and Tezcuco, acquiring a
knowledge of the natives and
enough of their language to
close his epistle with a sentence
of it as a sample.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> But no
chance effort of this kind was
enough. It took systematic
endeavors on the part of the
priests to settle grammatical
principles and determine phonetic
values, and the measure
of their success was seen in the
speedy way in which the interpretation
of the old idiograms
was forgotten. Mr. Brevoort
has pointed out how much the
progress of what may be called
native literature, which is to-day
so helpful to us in filling the
picture of their ancient life, is
due to the labors in this process
of linguistic transfer of Motolinfa,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>

of the ablest student of the
ancient tongues in his day, as
Mendieta calls Father Sahagún,<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> who, dying in 1590 at ninety, had spent a good part of
a long life so that we of this generation might profit by his records.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming later into the field than Duran, Acosta, and Sahagún, and profiting from the
labors of his predecessors, we find in the <i>Monarchia Indiana</i> of Torquemada<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> the most
comprehensive treatment of the ancient history given to us by any of the early Spanish
writers. The book, however, is a provoking one, from the want of plan, its chronological
confusion, and the general lack of a critical spirit<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> pervading it.</p>

<p>It is usually held that the earliest amassment of native records for historical purposes,
after the Conquest, was that made by Ixtlilxochitl of the archives of his Tezcucan line,
which he used in his writings in a way that has not satisfied some later investigators.
Charnay says that in his own studies he follows Veytia by preference; but Prescott finds
beneath the high colors of the pictures of Ixtlilxochitl not a little to be commended.
Bandelier,<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> on the other hand, expresses a distrust when he says of Ixtlilxochitl that “he
is always a very suspicious authority, not because he is more confused than any other Indian
writer, but because he wrote for an interested object, and with a view of sustaining
tribal claims in the eyes of the Spanish government.”<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>Among the manuscripts which seem to have belonged to Ixtlilxochitl was the one
known in our day under the designation given to it by Brasseur de Bourbourg, <i>Codex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Chimalpopoca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> in honor of Faustino Chimalpopoca, a learned professor of Aztec, who
assisted Brasseur in translating it. The anonymous author had set to himself the task of
converting into the written native tongue a rendering of the ancient hieroglyphics, constituting,
as Brasseur says, a complete and regular history of Mexico and Colhuacan. He
describes it in his <i>Lettres à M. le duc de Valmy</i> (<i>lettre seconde</i>)&mdash;the first part (in Mexican)
being a history of the Chichimecas; the second (in Spanish), by another hand, elucidating
the antiquities&mdash;as the most rare and most precious of all the manuscripts
which escaped destruction, elucidating what was obscure in Gomara and Torquemada.</p>

<p>Brasseur based upon this MS. his account of the Toltec period in his <i>Nations Civilisées
du Mexique</i> (i. p. lxxviii), treating as an historical document what in later years,
amid his vagaries, he assumed to be but the record of geological changes.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> A similar use
was made by him of another MS., sometimes called a Memorial de Colhuacan, and which
he named the <i>Codex Gondra</i> after the director of the Museo Nacional in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>Brasseur says, in the <i>Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne</i>, that the <i>Chimalpopoca MS.</i> is
dated in 1558, but in his <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, i. p. lxxix, he says that it was written in 1563
and 1579, by a writer of Quauhtitlan, and not by Ixtlilxochitl, as was thought by Pichardo,
who with Gama possessed copies later owned by Aubin. The copy used by Brasseur
was, as he says, made from the MS. in the Boturini collection,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> where it was called <i>Historia
de los Reynos de Colhuacan y México</i>,<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> and it is supposed to be the original, now
preserved in the Museo Nacional de México. It is not all legible, and that institution
has published only the better preserved and earlier parts of it, though Aubin’s copies are
said to contain the full text. This edition, which is called <i>Anales de Cuauhtitlan</i>, is
accompanied by two Spanish versions, the early one made for Brasseur, and a new one
executed by Mendoza and Solis, and it is begun in the <i>Anales del Museo Nacional</i> for
1879 (vol. i.).<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>The next after Ixtlilxochitl to become conspicuous as a collector, was Sigüenza y
Gongora (b. 1645), and it was while he was the chief keeper of such records<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> that the
Italian traveller Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Carreri examined them, and made some
record of them.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> A more important student inspected the collection, which was later
gathered in the College of San Pedro and San Pablo, and this was Clavigero,<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> who manifested
a particular interest in the picture-writing of the Mexicans,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> and has given us a

<p>The best known efforts at collecting material for the ante-Spanish history of Mexico
were made by Boturini,<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> who had come over to New Spain in 1736, on some agency for
a descendant of Montezuma, the Countess de
Santibañez. Here he became interested in the
antiquities of the country, and spent eight years
roving about the country picking up manuscripts
and pictures, and seeking in vain for some one to
explain their hieroglyphics. Some action on his
part incurring the displeasure of the public authorities,
he was arrested, his collection<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> taken
from him, and he was sent to Spain. On the voyage
an English cruiser captured the vessel in which
he was, and he thus lost whatever he chanced to
have with him.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> What he left behind remained in
the possession of the government, and became the
spoil of damp, revolutionists, and curiosity-seekers.
Once again in Spain, Boturini sought redress of the
Council of the Indies, and was sustained by it in
his petition; but neither he nor his heirs succeeded
in recovering his collection. He also prepared a
book setting forth how he proposed, by the aid of these old manuscripts and pictures, to resuscitate
the forgotten history of the Mexicans. The book<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> is a jumble of notions; but
appended to it was what gives it its chief value, a “Catálogo del Museo histórico Indiano,”
which tells us what the collection was. While it was thus denied to its collector, Mariano
Veytia,<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> who had sympathized with Boturini in Madrid, had possession, for a while at
least, of a part of it, and made use of it in his <i>Historia Antigua de Méjico</i>, but it is
denied, as usually stated, that the authorities upon his death (1778) prevented the publication
of his book. The student was deprived of Veytia’s results till his MS. was ably
edited, with notes and an appendix, by C. F. Ortega (Mexico, 1836).<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> Another, who was
connected at a later day with the Boturini collection, and who was a more accurate writer
than Veytia, was Antonio de Leon y Gama, born in Mexico in 1735. His <i>Descripcion
histórica y Cronológica de las Dos Piedras</i> (Mexico, 1832)<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> was occasioned by the finding,
in 1790, of the great Mexican Calendar Stone and other sculptures in the Square of
Mexico. This work brought to bear Gama’s great learning to the interpretation of these
relics, and to an exposition of the astronomy and mythology of the ancient Mexicans,
in a way that secured the commendation of Humboldt.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p>During these years of uncertainty respecting the Boturini collection, a certain hold
upon it seems to have been shared successively by Pichardo and Sanchez, by which in the
end some part came to the Museo Nacional, in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> It was also the subject of lawsuits,
which finally resulted in the dispersion of what was left by public auction, at a time
when Humboldt was passing through Mexico, and some of its treasures were secured by
him and placed in the Berlin Museum. Others passed hither and thither (a few to Kingsborough),
but not in a way to obscure their paths, so that when, in 1830, Aubin was sent
to Mexico by the French government, he was able to secure a considerable portion of
them, as the result of searches during the next ten years. It was with the purpose, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
years later, of assisting in the elucidation and publication of Aubin’s collection that the
Société Américaine de France was established. The collection of historical records, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Aubin held it, was described, in 1881, by himself,<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> when he divided his Mexican picture-writings
into two classes,&mdash;those which had belonged to Boturini, and those which had
not.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> Aubin at the same time described his collection of the Spanish MSS. of Ixtlilxochitl,<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
while he congratulated himself that he had secured the old picture-writings upon
which that native writer depended in the early part of his <i>Historia Chichimeca</i>. These
Spanish MSS. bear the signature and annotations of Veytia.</p>

<p>If we allow the first place among native writers, using the Spanish tongue, to Ixtlilxochitl,
we find several others of considerable service: Diego Muñoz Camargo, a Tlaxcallan
Mestizo, wrote (1585) a <i>Historia de Tlaxcallan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> Tezozomoc’s <i>Crónica Mexicana</i> is

MS. by a Cacique of Quiahuiztlan, Juan Ventura Zapata y Mendoza, which brings the
<i>Crónica de la muy noble y real Ciudad de Tlaxcallan</i> from the earliest times down to
1689; but it is not now known. Torquemada and others cite two native Tezcucan writers,&mdash;Juan
Bautista Pomar, whose <i>Relacion de las Antigüedades de los Indios</i><a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> treats of the
manners of his ancestors, and Antonio Pimentel, whose <i>Relaciones</i> are well known. The
MS. <i>Crónica Mexicana</i> of Anton Muñon Chimalpain (b. 1579), tracing the annals from
the eleventh century, is or was among the Aubin MSS.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> There was collected before 1536,

Brinton<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> does not know a single case where a Maya author has written in the Spanish
tongue, as the Aztecs did, under Spanish influence. We owe more to Dr. Daniel Garrison
Brinton than to any one else for the elucidation of the native records, and he had
had the advantage of the collection of Yucatan MSS. formed by Dr. C. H. Berendt,<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>

<p>After the destruction of the ancient records by Landa, considerable efforts were made
throughout Yucatan, in a sort of reactionary spirit, to recall the lingering recollections
of what these manuscripts contained. The grouping of such recovered material became
known as Chilan Balam.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> It is from local collections of this kind that Brinton selected the
narratives which he has published as <i>The Maya Chronicles</i>, being the first volume of his
<i>Library of Aboriginal American Literature</i>. The original texts<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> are accompanied by an
English translation. One of the books, the Chilan Balam of Mani, had been earlier printed
by Stephens, in his <i>Yucatan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> The only early Spanish chronicle is Bishop Landa’s <i>Relation
des choses de Yucatan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> which follows not an original, but a copy of the bishop’s
text, written, as Brasseur thinks, thirty years after Landa’s death, or about 1610, and
which Brasseur first brought to the world’s attention when he published his edition, with
both Spanish and French texts, at Paris, in 1864. The MS. seems to have been incomplete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and was perhaps inaccurately copied at the time. At this date (1864) Brasseur had
become an enthusiast for his theory of the personification of the forces of nature in the old
recitals, and there was some distrust how far his zeal had affected his text; and moreover
he had not published the entire text, but had omitted about one sixth. Brasseur’s
method of editing became apparent when, in 1884, at Madrid, Juan de Dios de la Rada y
Delgado published literally the whole Spanish text, as an appendix to the Spanish translation
of Rosny’s essay on the hieratic writing. The Spanish editor pointed out some but
not all the differences between his text and Brasseur’s,&mdash;a scrutiny which Brinton has
perfected in his <i>Critical Remarks on the Editions of Landa’s Writings</i> (Philad., 1887).<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>
Landa gives extracts from a work by Bernardo Lizana, relating to Yucatan, of which it
is difficult to get other information.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> The earliest published historical narrative was
Cogolludo’s <i>Historia de Yucathan</i> (Madrid, 1688).<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> Stephens, in his study of the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
speaks of it as “voluminous, confused, and ill-digested,” and says “it might almost be
called a history of the Franciscan friars, to which order Cogolludo belonged.”<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The native sources of the aboriginal history of Guatemala, and of what is sometimes
called the Quiché-Cakchiquel Empire, are not abundant,<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> but the most important are the
<i>Popul Vuh</i>, a traditional book of the Quichés, and the <i>Memorial de Tecpan-Atitlan</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Popul Vuh</i> was discovered in the library of the university at Guatemala, probably
not far from 1700,<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> by Francisco Ximenez, a missionary in a mountain village of the
country. Ximenez did not find the original Quiché book, but a copy of it, made after it
was lost, and later than the Conquest, which we may infer was reproduced from memory
to replace the lost text, and in this way it may have received some admixture of Christian
thought.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> It was this sort of a text that Ximenez turned into Spanish; and this version,
with the copy of the Quiché, which Ximenez also made, is what has come down to us.
Karl Scherzer, a German traveller<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> in the country, found Ximenez’ work, which had
seemingly passed into the university library on the suppression of the monasteries, and
which, as he supposes, had not been printed because of some disagreeable things in
it about the Spanish treatment of the natives. Scherzer edited the MS., which was
published as <i>Las Historias del Origen de los Indios de Esta Provincia de Guatemala</i><a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>
(Vienna, 1857).</p>

<p>Brasseur, who had seen the Ximenez MSS. in 1855, considered the Spanish version
untrustworthy, and so with the aid of some natives he gave it a French rendering, and
republished it a few years later as <i>Popol Vuh</i>. <i>Le Livre sacré et les Mythes de l’antiquité
américaine, avec les livres héroïques et historiques des Quichés. Ouvrage original des
indigènes de Guatémala, texte Quiché et trad. française en regard, accompagnée de notes
philologiques et d’un commentaire sur la mythologie et les migrations des peuples anciens
de l’Amérique, etc., composé sur des documents originaux et inédits</i> (Paris, 1861).</p>

<p>Brasseur’s introduction bears the special title: <i>Dissertation sur les mythes de l’antiquité
Américaine sur la probabilité des Communications existant anciennement d’un Continent
à l’autre, et sur les migrations des peuples indigènes de l’Amérique</i>,&mdash;in which he took
occasion to elucidate his theory of cataclysms and Atlantis. He speaks of his annotations
as the results of his observations among the Quichés and of his prolonged studies.
He calls the <i>Popul Vuh</i> rather a national than a sacred book,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and thinks it the original in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
some part of the “Livre divin des Toltèques,” the Teo-Amoxtli.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> Brinton avers that
neither Ximenez nor Brasseur has adequately translated the Quiché text,<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> and sees no
reason to think that the matter has been in any way influenced by the Spanish contact,
emanating indeed long before that event; and he has based some studies upon it.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> In
this opinion Bandelier is at variance, at least as regards the first portion, for he believes
it to have been <i>written</i> after the Conquest and under Christian influences.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> Brasseur in
some of his other writings has further discussed the matter.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Memorial of Tecpan-Atitlan</i>, to use Brasseur’s title, is an incomplete MS.,<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>
found in 1844 by Juan Gavarrete in rearranging the MSS. of the convent of San Francisco,
of Guatemala, and it was by Gavarrete that a Spanish version of Brasseur’s rendering
was printed in 1873 in the <i>Boletin de la Sociedad económica de Guatemala</i> (nos.
29-43). This translation by Brasseur, made in 1856, was never printed by him, but, passing
into Pinart’s hands with Brasseur’s collections,<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> it was entrusted by that collector to
Dr. Brinton, who selected the parts of interest (46 out of 96 pp.), and included it as vol. vi.
in his <i>Library of Aboriginal American Literature</i>, under the title of <i>The annals of the
Cakchiquels</i>. <i>The original text, with a translation, notes, and introduction</i> (Philadelphia,
1885).</p>

<p>Brinton disagrees with Brasseur in placing the date of its beginning towards the opening
of the eleventh century, and puts it rather at about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1380. Brasseur says he
received the original from Gavarrete, and it would seem to have been a copy made between
1620 and 1650, though it bears internal evidence of having been written by one
who was of adult age at the time of the Conquest.</p>

<p>Brinton’s introduction discusses the ethnological position of the Cakchiquels, who he
thinks had been separated from the Mayas for a long period.</p>

<p>The next in importance of the Guatemalan books is the work of Francisco Antonio de
Fuentes y Guzman, <i>Historia de Guatemala, ó Recordación florida escrita el siglo xvii., que
publica por primera vez con notas é ilustraciones F. Zaragoza</i> (Madrid, 1882-83), being
vols. 1 and 2 of the <i>Biblioteca de los americanistas</i>. The original MS., dated 1690, is in
the archives of the city of Guatemala. Owing to a tendency of the author to laud the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
natives, modern historians have looked with some suspicion on his authority, and have
pointed out inconsistencies and suspected errors.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> Of a later writer, Ramon de Ordoñez
(died about 1840), we have only the rough draught of a <i>Historia de la creation del Cielo y
de la tierra, conforme al sistema de la gentilidad Americana</i>, which is of importance for
traditions.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> This manuscript, preserved in the Museo Nacional in Mexico, is all that now
exists, representing the perfected work. Brasseur (<i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>, 113) had a copy of
this draught (made in 1848-49). The original fair copy was sent to Madrid for the press,
and it is suspected that the Council for the Indies suppressed it in 1805. Ramon cites a
manuscript <i>Hist. de la Prov. de San Vicente de Chiappas y Goathemala</i>, which is perhaps
the same as the <i>Crónica de la Prov. de Chiapas y Guatemala</i>, of which the seventh book
is in the Museo Nacional (<i>Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, n. s., i. 97; Brasseur, <i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>,
157).</p>

<p>The work of Antonio de Remesal is sometimes cited as <i>Historia general de las Indias
occidentales, y particular de la gobernacion de Chiapas y Guatemala</i>, and sometimes as
<i>Historia de la Provincia de San Vicente de Chyapa y Guatemala</i> (Madrid, 1619, 1620).<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Bandelier (<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, i. 95) has indicated the leading sources of the history
of Chiapas, so closely associated with Guatemala. To round the study of the aboriginal
period of this Pacific region, we may find something in Alvarado’s letters on the
Conquest;<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> in Las Casas for the interior parts, and in Alonso de Zurita’s <i>Relacion</i>, 1560,<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>

Guaxaca) the special source is Francisco de Burgoa’s <i>Geográfica descripcion de la
parte septentrional del Polo Artico de la América</i>, etc. (México, 1674), in two quarto volumes,&mdash;or
at least it is generally so regarded. Bandelier, who traces the works on Oajaca
(<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, n. s., i. 115), says there is a book of a modern writer, Juan B.
Carriedo, which follows Burgoa largely. Brasseur (<i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>, p. 33) speaks of
Burgoa as the only source which remains of the native history of Oajaca. He says it is a
very rare book, even in Mexico. He largely depends upon its full details in some parts
of his <i>Nations Civilisées</i> (iii. livre 9). Alonso de la Rea’s <i>Crónica de Mechoacan</i> (Mexico,
1648) and Basalenque’s <i>Crónica de San Augustin de Mechoacan</i> (Mexico, 1673) are books
which Brinton complains he could find in no library in the United States.</p>

<p class="p2">The earliest general account of all these ancient peoples which we have in English is
in the <i>History of America</i>, by William Robertson, who describes the condition of Mexico
at the time of the Conquest, and epitomizes the early Spanish accounts of the natives.
Prescott and Helps followed in his steps, with new facilities. Albert Gallatin brought the
powers of a vigorous intellect to bear, though but cursorily, upon the subject, in his
“Notes on the semi-civilized nations of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central America,” in the
<i>Amer. Ethnological Society’s Transactions</i> (N. Y., 1845, vol. i.), and he was about the
first to recognize the dangerous pitfalls of the pseudo-historical narratives of these peoples.

<p>During the American Civil War, when there were hopes of some permanence for French
influence in Mexico, the French government made some organized efforts to further the
study of the antiquities of the country, and the results were published in the <i>Archives
de la Commission Scientifique du Méxique</i>
(Paris, 1864-69, in 3 vols.).<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> The
Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, who took
a conspicuous part in this labor, has
probably done more than any other
Frenchman to bring into order the studies
upon these ancient races, and in
some directions he is our ultimate
source. Unfortunately his character as
an archæological expounder did not improve
as he went on, and he grew to be
the expositor of some wild notions that
have proved acceptable to few. He
tells us that he first had his attention
turned to American archæology by the
report, which had a short run in European
circles, of the discovery of a Macedonian
helmet and weapons in Brazil
in 1832, and by a review of Rio’s report
on Palenqué, which he read in the
<i>Journal des Savants</i>. Upon coming
to America, fresh from his studies in
Rome, he was made professor of history
in the seminary at Quebec in 1845-46, writing at that time a <i>Histoire du Canada</i>, of little
value. Later, in Boston, he perfected his English and read Prescott. Then we find him
at Rome poring over the <i>Codex Vaticanus</i>, and studying the <i>Codex Borgianus</i> in the
library of the Propaganda. In 1848 he returned to the United States, and, embarking at
New Orleans for Mexico, he found himself on shipboard in the company of the new French
minister, whom he accompanied, on landing, to the city of Mexico, being made almoner to
the legation. This official station gave him some advantage in beginning his researches,
in which Rafael Isidro Gondra, the director of the Museo, with the curators of the vice-regal
archives, and José Maria Andrade, the librarian of the university, assisted him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Later he gave himself to the study of the Nahua tongue, under the guidance of Faustino
Chimalpopoca Galicia, a descendant of a brother of Montezuma, then a professor in the
college of San Gregorio. In 1851 he was ready to print at Mexico, in French and Spanish,
his <i>Lettres pour servir d’introduction à l’histoire primitive des anciennes nations civilisées
du Méxique</i>, addressed (October, 1850) to the Duc de Valmy, in which he sketched
the progress of his studies up to that time. He speaks of it as “le premier fruit de mes
travaux d’archéologie et d’histoire méxicaines.”<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> It was this brochure which introduced
him to the attention of Squier and Aubin, and from the latter, during his residence in
Paris (1851-54), he received great assistance. Pressed in his circumstances, he was
obliged at this time to eke out his living by popular writing, which helped also to enable
him to publish his successive works.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> To complete his Central American studies, he
went again to America in 1854, and in Washington he saw for the first time the texts of
Las Casas and Duran, in the collection of Peter Force, who had got copies from Madrid.
He has given us<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> an account of his successful search for old manuscripts in Central America.
Finally, as the result of all these studies, he published his most important work,&mdash;<i>Histoire
des nations civilisées du Méxique et de l’Amérique centrale durant les siècles antérieurs
à C. Colomb, écrite sur des docs. origin. et entièrement inédits, puisés aux anciennes
archives des indigènes</i> (Paris, 1857-58).<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> This was the first orderly and extensive effort
to combine out of all available material, native and Spanish, a divisionary and consecutive
history of ante-Columbian times in these regions, to which he added from the native
sources a new account of the conquest by the Spaniards. His purpose to separate the
historic from the mythical may incite criticism, but his views are the result of more labor
and more knowledge than any one before him had brought to the subject.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> In his later
publications there is less reason to be satisfied with his results, and Brinton<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> even thinks
that “he had a weakness to throw designedly considerable obscurity about his authorities
and the sources of his knowledge.” His fellow-students almost invariably yield praise to
his successful research and to his great learning, surpassing perhaps that of any of them,
but they are one and all chary of adopting his later theories.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> These were expressed at
length in his <i>Quatre lettres sur le Mexique</i>. <i>Exposition du système hiéroglyphique mexicain.
La fin de l’âge de pierre. Époque glaciaire temporaire. Commencement de l’âge
de bronze. Origines de la civilisation et des religions de l’antiquité. D’après le Teo-Amoxtli</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
[etc.] (Paris, 1868), wherein he accounted as mere symbolism what he had earlier
elucidated as historical records, and connected the recital of the <i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i> with
the story of Atlantis, making that lost land the original seat of all old-world and new-world
civilization, and finding in that sacred history of Colhuacan and Mexico the secret evidence
of a mighty cataclysm that sunk the continent from Honduras (subsequently with
Yucatan elevated) to perhaps the Canaries.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Two years later, in his elucidation of the
<i>MS. Troano</i> (1869-70), this same theory governed all his study. Brasseur was quite
aware of the loss of estimation which followed upon his erratic change of opinion, as the
introduction to his <i>Bibl. Mex.-Guatémalienne</i> shows. No other French writer, however,
has so associated his name with the history of these early peoples.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>In Mexico itself the earliest general narrative was not cast in the usual historical form,
but in the guise of a dialogue, held night after night, between a Spaniard and an Indian,
the ancient history of the country was recounted. The author, Joseph Joaquin Granados
y Galvez, published it in 1778, as <i>Tardes Américanas: gobierno gentil y católico: breve y
particular noticia de toda la historia Indiana: sucesos, casos notables, y cosas ignoradas,
desde la entrada de la Gran nacion Tulteca á esta tierra de Anahuac, hasta los presentes
tiempos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p>The most comprehensive grouping of historical material is in the <i>Diccionario Universal
de historia y de Geografía</i> (Mexico, 1853-56),<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> of which Manuel Orozco y Berra was one
of the chief collaborators. This last author has in two other works added very much to
our knowledge of the racial and ancient history of the indigenous peoples. These are his
<i>Geografía de las lenguas y Carta Etnográfica de México</i> (Mexico, 1864),<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> and his <i>Historia
antigua y de la Conquista de México</i> (Mexico, 1880, in four volumes).<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> Perhaps
the most important of all the Mexican publications is Manuel Larrainzar’s <i>Estudios sobre
la historia de América, sus ruinas y antigüedades, comparadas con lo más notable del otro
Continente</i> (Mexico, 1875-1878, in five volumes).</p>

<p>In German the most important of recent books is Hermann Strebel’s <i>Alt-Mexico</i> (Hamburg,
1885); but Waitz’s <i>Amerikaner</i> (1864, vol. ii.) has a section on the Mexicans. Adolph
Bastian’s “Zur Geschichte des Alten Mexico” is contained in the second volume of his
<i>Culturländer des Alten America</i> (Berlin, 1878), in which he considers the subject of Quetzalcoatl,
the religious ceremonial, administrative and social life, as well as the different
stocks of the native tribes.</p>

and the Interpretation of such Authorities.</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE ancient so-called civilization which the Spaniards found in Mexico and Central America is the subject
of much controversy: in the first place as regards its origin, whether indigenous, or allied to and derived from
the civilizations of the Old World; and in the second place as regards its character, whether it was something
more than a kind of grotesque barbarism, or of a nature that makes even the Spanish culture, which supplanted
it, inferior in some respects by comparison.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> The first of these problems, as regards its origin, is considered
in another place. As respects the second, or its character, it is proposed here to follow the history of opinions.</p>

<p>In a book published at Seville in 1519, Martin Fernandez d’Enciso’s <i>Suma de geographia que trata de todas
las partidas y provincias del mundo: en especial de las Indias</i>,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> the European reader is supposed to have
received the earliest hints of the degree of civilization&mdash;if it be so termed&mdash;of which the succeeding Spanish
writers made so much. A brief sentence was thus the shadowy beginning of the stories of grandeur and magnificence<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>
which we find later in Cortes, Bernal Diaz, Las Casas, Torquemada, Sahagún, Ramusio, Gomara,
Oviedo, Zurita, Tezozomoc, and Ixtlilxochitl, and which is repeated often with accumulating effect in Acosta,
Herrera, Lorenzana, Solis, Clavigero, and their successors.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> Bandelier<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> points out how Robertson, in his views
of Mexican civilization as in “the infancy of civil life,”<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> really opened the view for the first time of the exaggerated
and uncritical estimates of the older writers, which Morgan has carried in our day to the highest
pitch, and, as it would seem, without sufficient recognition of some of the contrary evidence.</p>

<p>It has usually been held that the creation among the Mexicans about thirty years after the founding of Mexico
of a chief-of-men (Tlacatecuhtli) instituted a feudal monarchy. Bandelier,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> speaking of the application of
feudal terms by the old writers to Mexican institutions, says: “What in their first process of thinking was
merely a comparative, became very soon a positive terminology for the purpose of describing institutions to
which this foreign terminology never was adapted.” He instances that the so-called “king” of these early
writers was a translation of the native term, which in fact only meant “one of those who spoke;” that is, a
prominent member of the council.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> Bandelier traces the beginning of the feudal ideas as a graft upon the
native systems, in the oldest document issued by Europeans on Mexican soil, when Cortes (May 20, 1519) conferred
land on his allies, the chiefs of Axapusco and Tepeyahualco, and for the first time made their offices
hereditary. It is Bandelier’s opinion that “the grantees had no conception of the true import of what they
accepted; neither did Cortes conceive the nature of their ideas.” This was followed after the Spanish occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Mexico by the institution of “repartimientos,” through which the natives became serfs of the soil to the
conquerors.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>The story about this unknown splendor of a strange civilization fascinated the world nearly half a century ago
in the kindly recital of Prescott;<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> but it was observed that he quoted too often the somewhat illusory and
exaggerated statements of Ixtlilxochitl, and was not a little attracted by the gorgeous pictures of Waldeck and
Dupaix. With such a charming depicter, the barbaric gorgeousness of this ancient empire, as it became the
fashion to call it, gathered a new interest, which has never waned, and Morgan<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> is probably correct in affirming
that it “has called into existence a larger number of works than were ever before written upon any people of
the same number and of the same importance.”<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Even those who, like Tylor, had gone to Mexico sceptics, had
been forced to the conclusion that Prescott’s pictures were substantially correct, and setting aside what he felt
to be the monstrous exaggerations of Solis, Gomara, and the rest, he could not find the history much less trustworthy
than European history of the same period.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> It has been told in another place<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> how the derogatory
view, as opposed to the views of Prescott, were expressed by R. A. Wilson in his <i>New Conquest of Mexico</i>, in
assuming that all the conquerors said was baseless fabrication, the European Montezuma becoming a petty
Indian chief, and the great city of Mexico a collection of hovels in an everglade,&mdash;the ruins of the country
being accounted for by supposing them the relics of an ancient Phœnician civilization, which had been stamped
out by the inroads of barbarians, whose equally barbarious descendants the Spaniards were in turn to overcome.
It cannot be said that such iconoclastic opinions obtained any marked acceptance; but it was apparent
that the notion of the exaggeration of the Spanish accounts was becoming sensibly fixed in the world’s opinion.
We see this reaction in a far less excessive way in Daniel Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i> (i. 325, etc.), and he was
struck, among other things, with the utter obliteration of the architectural traces of the conquered race in the
city of Mexico itself.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> When, in 1875, Hubert H. Bancroft published the second volume of his <i>Native Races</i>,
he confessed “that much concerning the Aztec civilization had been greatly exaggerated by the old Spanish
writers, and for obvious reasons;” but he contended that the stories of their magnificence must in the main be
accepted, because of the unanimity of witnesses, notwithstanding their copying from one another, and because
of the evidence of the ruins.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> He strikes his key-note in his chapter on the “Government of the Nahua Nations,”
in speaking of it as “monarchical and nearly absolute;”<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> but it was perhaps in his chapter on the “Palaces
and Households of the Nahua Kings,” where he fortifies his statement by numerous references, that he carried
his descriptions to the extent that allied his opinions to those who most unhesitatingly accepted the old stories.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>The most serious arraignment of these long-accepted views was by Lewis H. Morgan, who speaks of them
as having “caught the imagination and overcome the critical judgment of Prescott, ravaged the sprightly brain
of Brasseur de Bourbourg, and carried up in a whirlwind our author at the Golden Gate.”<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>Morgan’s studies had been primarily among the Iroquois, and by analogy he had applied his reasoning to the
aboriginal conditions of Mexico and Central America, thus degrading their so-called civilization to the level of
the Indian tribal organization, as it was understood in the North.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> Morgan’s confidence in its deductions was
perfect, and he was not very gracious in alluding to the views of his opponents. He looked upon “the fabric of
Aztec romance as the most deadly encumbrance upon American ethnology.”<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> The Spanish chroniclers, as he
contended, “inaugurated American aboriginal history upon a misconception of Indian life, which has remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
substantially unquestioned till recently.”<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> He charges upon ignorance of the structure and principles of Indian
society, the perversion of all the writers,<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> from Cortes to Bancroft, who, as he says, unable to comprehend its
peculiarities, invoked the imagination to supply whatever was necessary to fill out the picture.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> The actual
condition to which the Indians of Spanish America had reached was, according to his schedule, the upper status
of barbarism, between which and the beginning of civilization he reckoned an entire ethnical period. “In the
art of government they had not been able to rise above gentile institutions and establish political society.
This fact,” Morgan continues, “demonstrates the impossibility of privileged classes and of potentates, under
their institutions, with power to enforce the labor of the people for the erection of palaces for their use, and
explains the absence of such structures.”<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<p>This is the essence of the variance of the two schools of interpretation of the Aztec and Maya life. The
reader of Bancroft will find, on the other hand, due recognition of an imperial system, with its monarch and
nobles and classes of slaves, and innumerable palaces, of which we see to-day the ruins. The studies of Bandelier
are appealed to by Morgan as substantiating his view.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> Mrs. Zelia Nuttall (<i>Proc. Am. Assoc. Adv. Sci.</i>,
Aug., 1886) claims to be able to show that the true interpretation of the Borgian and other codices points in
part at least to details of a communal life.</p>

<p>The special issues which for a test Morgan takes with Bancroft are in regard to the character of the house
in which Montezuma lived, and of the dinner which is represented by Bernal Diaz and the rest as the daily
banquet of an imperial potentate. Morgan’s criticism is in his <i>Houses and House Life of the American Aborigines</i>
(Washington, 1881).<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> The basis of this book had been intended for a fifth Part of his <i>Ancient Society</i>,
but was not used in that publication. He printed the material, however, in papers on “Montezuma’s Dinner”
(<i>No. Am. Rev.</i>, Ap. 1876), “Houses of the Moundbuilders” (<i>Ibid.</i>, July, 1876), and “Study of the Houses
and House Life of the Indian Tribes” (<i>Archæol. Inst. of Amer. Publ.</i>). These papers amalgamated now
make the work called <i>Houses and House Life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<p>Morgan argues that a communal mode of living accords with the usages of aboriginal hospitality, as well as
with their tenure of lands,<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> and with the large buildings, which others call palaces, and he calls joint tenement
houses. He instances, as evidence of the size of such houses, that at Cholula four hundred Spaniards and one
thousand allied Indians found lodging in such a house; and he points to Stephens’s description of similar communal
establishments which he found in our day near Uxmal.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> He holds that the inference of communal
living from such data as these is sufficient to warrant a belief in it, although none of the early Spanish writers
mention such communism as existing; while they actually describe a communal feast in what is known as
Montezuma’s dinner;<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> and while the plans of the large buildings now seen in ruins are exactly in accord with
the demands of separate families united in joint occupancy. In such groups, he holds, there is usually one building
devoted to the purpose of a Tecpan, or official house of the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> Under the pressure to labor, which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Spaniards inflicted on their occupants, these communal dwellers were driven, to escape such servitude, into the
forest, and thus their houses fell into decay. Morgan’s views attracted the adhesion of not a few archæologists,
like Bandelier and Dawson; but in Bancroft, as contravening the spirit of his <i>Native Races</i>, they begat
feelings that substituted disdain for convincing arguments.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> The less passionate controversialists point out,
with more effect, how hazardous it is, in coming to conclusions on the quality of the Nahua, Maya, or Quiché
conditions of life, to ignore such evidences as those of the hieroglyphics, the calendars, the architecture and
carvings, the literature and the industries, as evincing quite another kind, rather than degree, of progress,
from that of the northern Indians.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>

<p class="pc1"><a name="n176" id="n176">II.</a><span class="smcap">Bibliographical Notes upon the Ruins and Archæological Remains of Mexico and
Central America.</span></p>

<p class="p1">Elsewhere in this work some account is given of the comprehensive treatment of American antiquities. It
is the purpose of this note to characterize such other descriptions as have been specially confined to the
antiquities of Mexico, Central America, and adjacent parts; together with noting occasionally those more
comprehensive works which have sections on these regions. The earliest and most distinguished of all such
treatises are the writings of Alexander von Humboldt,<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> to whom may be ascribed the paternity of what the
French define as the Science of Americanism, which, however, took more definite shape and invited discipleship
when the Société Américaine de France was formed, and Aubin in his <i>Mémoire sur la peinture didactique
et l’écriture figurative des Anciens Méxicains</i> furnished a standard of scholarship. How new this
science was may be deduced from the fact that Robertson, the most distinguished authority on early American
history, who wrote in English, in the last part of the preceding century, had ventured to say that in all New
Spain there was not “a single monument or vestige of any building more ancient than the Conquest.” After
Humboldt, the most famous of what may be called the pioneers of this art were Kingsborough, Dupaix, and
Waldeck, whose publications are sufficiently described elsewhere. The most startling developments came from
the expeditions of Stephens and Catherwood, the former mingling both in his <i>Central America</i> and <i>Yucatan</i>
the charms of a personal narrative with his archæological studies, while the draughtsman, beside furnishing the
sketches for Stephens’s book, embodied his drawings on a larger scale in the publication which passes under
his own name.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> The explorations of Charnay are those which have excited the most interest of late years,
though equally significant results have been produced by such special explorers as Squier in Nicaragua, Le
Plongeon in Yucatan, and Bandelier in Mexico.</p>

<p>The labors of the French archæologist, which began in 1858, resulted in the work <i>Cités et ruines Américaines:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Mitla, Palenqué, Izamal, Chichen-Itza, Uxmal, recueillies et photographiées par Désiré Charnay,
avec un Texte par M. Viollet le Duc</i>. (Paris, 1863.) Charnay contributed to this joint publication, beside
the photographs, a paper called “Le Méxique, 1858-61,&mdash;souvenirs et impressions de Voyage.” The Architect
Viollet le Duc gives us in the same book an essay by an active, well-equipped, and ingenious mind,
but his speculations about the origin of this Southern civilization and its remains are rather curious than convincing.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<p>The public began to learn better what Charnay’s full and hearty confidence in his own sweeping assertions
was, when he again entered the field in a series of papers on the ruins of Central America which he contributed

        <p class="pf400">After a sketch in Bandelier’s <i>Archæological Tour</i>, p. 233, who also gives a plan of the mound. The modern Church
of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios is on the summit, where there are no traces of aboriginal works. A paved road leads
to the top. A suburban road skirts its base, and fields of maguey surround it. The circuit of the base is 3859 feet, and
the mound covers nearly twenty acres. Estimates of its height are variously given from 165 to 208 feet, according as one
or another base line is chosen. It is built of adobe brick laid in clay, and it has suffered from erosion, slides, and other
effects of time. There are some traces of steps up the side. Bandelier (pl. xv.) also gives a fac-simile of an old map of
Cholula. The earliest picture which we have of the mound, evidently thought by the first Spaniards to be a natural one,
is in the arms of Cholula (1540). There are other modern cuts in Carbajal-Espinosa’s <i>Mexico</i> (i. 195); <i>Archæologia
Americana</i> (i. 12); Brocklehurst’s <i>Mexico to-day</i>, 182. The degree of restoration which draughtsmen allow to themselves,
accounts in large measure for the great diversity of appearance which the mound makes in the different drawings of it.
There is a professed restoration by Mothes in Armin’s <i>Heutige Mexico</i>, 63, 68, 72. The engraving in Humboldt is
really a restoration (<i>Vues</i>, etc., pl. vii., or pl. viii. of the folio ed.). Bandelier gives a slight sketch of a restoration (p.
246, pl. viii.).</p>

<p>We proceed now to note geographically some of the principal ruins. In the vicinity of Vera Cruz the pyramid
of Papantla is the conspicuous monument,<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> but there is little else thereabouts needing particular mention.
Among the ruins of the central plateau of Mexico, the famous pyramid of Cholula is best known. The time
of its construction is a matter about which archæologists are not agreed, though it is perhaps to be connected
with the earliest period of the Nahua power. Duran, on the other hand, has told a story of its erection by
the giants, overcome by the Nahuas.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> Its purpose is equally debatable, whether intended for a memorial, a
refuge, a defence, or a spot of worship&mdash;very likely the truth may be divided among them all.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> It is a similar
problem for divided opinion whether it was built by a great display of human energy, in accordance with the
tradition that the bricks which composed its surface were passed from hand to hand by a line of men, extending
to the spot where they were made leagues away, or constructed by a slower process of accretion, spread
over successive generations, which might not have required any marvellous array of workmen.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> The fierce
conflict which&mdash;as some hold&mdash;Cortés had with the natives around the mound and on its slopes settled its
fate; and the demolition begun thereupon, and continued by the furious desolaters of the Church, has been
aided by the erosions of time and the hand of progress, till the great monument has become a ragged and corroded
hill, which might to the casual observer stand for the natural base, given by the Creator, to the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
chapel that now crowns its summit; but if Bandelier’s view (p. 249) is correct, that none of the conquerors
mention it, then the conflict which is recorded took place, not here, but on the vanished mound of Quetzalcoatl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
which in Bandelier’s opinion was a different structure from this more famous mound, while other writers
pronounce it the shrine itself of Quetzalcoatl.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

volume. A photographic reproduction, as the “Stone of the Sun,” is given in Bandelier’s <i>Archæological Tour</i>, p. 54,
where he summarizes the history of it, with references, including a paper by Alfredo Chavero, in the <i>Anales del Museo

that in Carlos Nebel’s <i>Viaje pintoresco y Arqueológico sobre la República Mejicana</i>, 1829-1834 (Paris, 1839),
is the best, while the engravings given by Humboldt (pl. xxiii.) and others are more or less erroneous. Cf. other cuts in

<p class="pn">Wilson in his <i>Prehistoric Man</i> (i. 246) says: “By the unaided results of native science, the dwellers on the Mexican
plateau had effected an adjustment of civil to solar time so nearly correct that when the Spaniards landed on their coast,

the barbarian nation whose civilization they so speedily effaced.”</p>

stood in the Mexican market-place, and was used in regulating the stated market-days.</p></div>

<p>We have reference to a Cholula mound in some of the earliest writers. Bernal Diaz counted the steps on its
side.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> Motolinía saw it within ten years of the Conquest, when it was overgrown and much ruined. Sahagún
says it was built for defensive purposes. Rojas, in his <i>Relacion de Cholula</i>, 1581, calls it a fortress, and says the
Spaniards levelled its convex top to plant there a cross, where later, in 1594, they built a chapel. Torquemada,
following Motolinía and the later Mendieta, says it was never finished, and was decayed in his time, though he
traced the different levels. Its interest as a relic thus dates almost from the beginnings of the modern history
of the region. Boturini mentions its four terraces. Clavigero, in 1744, rode up its sides on horseback, impelled
by curiosity, and found it hard work even then to look upon it as other than a natural hill.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> The earliest of
the critical accounts of it, however, is Humboldt’s, made from examinations in 1803, when much more than
now of its original construction was observable, and his account is the one from which most travellers have
drawn,&mdash;the result of close scrutiny in his text and of considerable license in his plate, in which he aimed at
something like a restoration.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> The latest critical examination is in Bandelier’s “Studies about Cholula and
its vicinity,” making part iii. of his <i>Archæological Tour in Mexico in 1881</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>What are called the finest ruins in Mexico are those of Xochicalco, seventy-five miles southwest of the capital,
consisting of a mound of five terraces supported by masonry, with a walled area on the summit. Of late years
a cornfield surrounds what is left of the pyramidal structure, which was its crowning edifice, and which up to
the middle of the last century had five receding stories, though only one now appears. It owes its destruction
to the needs which the proprietors of the neighboring sugar-works have had for its stones. The earliest
account of the ruins appeared in the “Descripcion (1791) de los antiqüedades de Xochicalco” of José Antonio
Alzate y Ramirez, in the <i>Gacetas de Literatura</i> (Mexico, 1790-94, in 3 vols.; reprinted Puebla, 1831, in 4
vols.), accompanied by plates, which were again used in Pietro Marquez’s <i>Due Antichi Monumenti de Architettura
Messicana</i> (Roma, 1804),<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> with an Italian version of Alzate, from which the French translation in
Dupaix was made. Alzate furnished the basis of the account in Humboldt’s <i>Vues</i> (i. 129; pl. ix. of folio ed.),
and Waldeck (<i>Voyage pitt.</i>, 69) regrets that Humboldt adopted so inexact a description as that of Alzate.
From Nebel (<i>Viage pintoresco</i>) we get our best graphic representations, for Tylor (<i>Anahuac</i>) says that Casteñeda’s
drawings, accompanying Dupaix, are very incorrect. Bancroft says that one, at least, of these drawings
in Kingsborough bears not the slightest resemblance to the one given in Dupaix. In 1835 there were
explorations made under orders of the Mexican government, which were published in the <i>Revista Mexicana</i>
(i. 539,&mdash;reprinted in the <i>Diccionario Universal</i>, x. 938). Other accounts, more or less helpful, are given by

much deceived Charnay, earlier, as to cause him to make casts of them for the Paris Museum, he at a later day pronounced
forgeries; and he says that they, with many others which are seen in public and private museums, were manufactured
at Tlatiloco, a Mexican suburb, between 1820 and 1828. See Holmes on the trade in Mexican spurious relics

<p>Bancroft (iv. ch. 7) has given a separate chapter to the antiquities of Oajaca (Oaxaca) and Guerrero, as the
most southern of what he terms the Nahua people, including
and lying westerly of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and he
speaks of it as a region but little known to travellers, except
as they pass through a part of it lying on the commercial
route from Acapulco to the capital city of Mexico. Bancroft’s
summary, with his references, must suffice for the inquirer
for all except the principal group of ruins in this
region, that of Mitla (or Lyó-Baa), of which a full recapitulation
of authorities may be made, most of which are also to
be referred to for the lesser ruins, though, as Bancroft points
out, the information respecting Monte Alban and Zachila is
far from satisfactory. Of Monte Alban, Dupaix and Charnay
are the most important witnesses, and the latter says
that he considers Monte Alban “one of the most precious
remains, and very surely the most ancient of the American
civilizations.”<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> On Dupaix alone we must depend for what
we know of Zachila.</p>

<p>It is, however, of Mitla (sometime Miquitlan, Mictlan) that
more considerable mention must be made, and its ruins,
about thirty miles southerly from Mexico, have been oftenest
visited, as they deserve to be; and we have to regret that
Stephens never took them within the range of his observations.
Their demolition had begun during a century or two
previous to the Spanish Conquest, and was not complete
even then. Nature is gloomy, and even repulsive in its desolation
about the ruins;<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> but a small village still exists

<p>The earliest of the modern explorers were Luis Martin, a
Mexican architect, and Colonel de la Laguna, who examined the ruins in 1802; and it was from Martin and his
drawings that Humboldt drew the information with which, in 1810, he first engaged the attention of the general
public upon Mitla, in his <i>Vues des Cordillères</i>. Dupaix’s visit was in 1806. The architect Eduard L.
Mühlenpfordt, in his <i>Versuch einer getreuen Schilderung der Republik Mejico</i> (Hannover, 1844, in 2 vols.),
says that he made plans and drawings in 1830,<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> which, passing into the hands of Juan B. Carriedo, were used
by him to illustrate a paper, “Los palacios antiguos de Mitla,” in the <i>Ilustracion Mexicana</i> (vol. ii.), in
which he set forth the condition of the ruins in 1852. Meanwhile, in 1837, some drawings had been made,
which were twenty years later reproduced in the ninth volume of the <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge</i>,
as Brantz Mayer’s <i>Observations on Mexican history and archæology, with a special notice of Zapotec,
remains as delineated in Mr. J. G. Sawkins’s drawings of Mitla, etc.</i> (Washington, 1857). Bancroft points
out (iv. 406) that the inaccuracies and impossibilities of Sawkins’ drawings are such as to lead to the conclusion
that he pretended to explorations which he never made, and probably drafted his views from some indefinite
information; and that Mayer was deceived, having no more precise statements than Humboldt’s by which to
test the drawings. Matthieu Fossey visited the ruins in 1838; but his account in his <i>Le Méxique</i> (Paris,
1857) is found by Bancroft to be mainly a borrowed one. G. F. von Tempsky’s <i>Mitla, a narrative of incidents
and personal adventure on a journey in Mexico, Guatemala and Salvador, 1853-1855, edited by J. S.
Bell</i> (London, 1858), deceives us by the title into supposing that considerable attention is given in the book to
Mitla, but we find him spending but a part of a day there in February, 1854 (p. 250). The book is not prized;
Bandelier calls it of small scientific value, and Bancroft says his plates must have been made up from other
sources than his own observations.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Charnay, here, as well as elsewhere, made for us some important photographs

series of thirty-four fine plates as <i>Album de Vistas fotográficas de las Antiguas Ruinas de los palacios de
Mitla</i> (Oaxaca, 1874). In 1864, J. W. von Müller, in his <i>Reisen in den Vereinigten Staaten, Canada und

summarized existing knowledge is that of Bandelier in his <i>Archæological Tour in Mexico in 1881</i>
(Boston, 1885), published as no. ii. of the American series of the <i>Papers of the Archæological Institute of
America</i>, which is illustrated with heliotypes and sketch plans of the ruins and architectural details in all
their geometrical symmetry. Bancroft (iv. 392, etc.) could only give a plan of the ruins based on the sketches
of Mühlenpfordt as published by Carriedo, but the student will find a more careful one<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> in Bandelier, who

<p>There is no part of Spanish America richer in architectural remains than the northern section of Yucatan,
and Bancroft (iv. ch. 5) has occasion to enumerate and to describe with more or less fullness between fifty and
sixty independent groups of ruins.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> Stephens explored forty-four of these abandoned towns, and such was
the native ignorance that of only a few of them could anything be learned in Merida. And yet that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
country was the land of a peculiar architecture was known to the earliest explorers. Francisco Hernandez de
Cordova in 1517, Juan de Grijalva in 1518, Cortés himself in 1519, and Francisco de Montejo in 1527 observed
the ruins in Cozumel, an island off the northwest coast of the peninsula, and at other points of the shore.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> It
is only, however, within the present century that
we have had any critical notices. Rio heard reports
of them merely. Lorenzo de Zavala saw
only Uxmal, as his account given in Dupaix
shows. The earliest detailed descriptions were
those of Waldeck in his <i>Voyage pittoresque et achéologique
dans la province d’Yucatan</i> (Paris,
1838, folio, with steel plates and lithographs), but
he also saw little more than the ruins of Uxmal,
in the expedition in which he had received pecuniary
support from Lord Kingsborough.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> It is to
John L. Stephens and his accompanying draughtsman,
Frederic Catherwood, that we owe by far the
most essential part of our knowledge of the Yucatan
remains. He had begun a survey of Uxmal
in 1840, but had made little progress when the illness
of his artist broke up his plans. Accordingly
he gave the world but partial results in his <i>Incidents
of Travel in Central America</i>. Not satisfied
with his imperfect examination, he returned to
Yucatan in 1841, and in 1843 published at New
York the book which has become the main source
of information for all compilers ever since, his <i>Incidents
of Travel in Yucatan</i> (N. Y., 1842; London,
1843; again, N. Y., 1856, 1858). It was in
the early days of the Daguerrean process, and
Catherwood took with him a camera, from which
his excellent drawings derive some of their fidelity. They appeared in his own <i>Views of Ancient Monuments
in Central America</i> (N. Y., 1844), on a larger scale than in Stephens’s smaller pages.</p>

<p>Stephens’s earlier book had had an almost immediate success. The reviewers were unanimous in commendation,
as they might well be.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> It has been asserted that it was in order to avail of this new interest that a resident
of New Orleans, Mr. B. M. Norman, hastened to Yucatan, while Stephens was there a second time, and
during the winter of 1841-42 made the trip among the ruins, which is recorded in his <i>Rambles in Yucatan, or
Notes of Travel through the peninsula, including a Visit to the Remarkable Ruins of Chi-chen, Kabah
Zayi, and Uxmal</i> (New York, 1843).<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<p>The Daguerrean camera was also used by the Baron von Friederichsthal in his studies at Uxmal and
Chichen-Itza, and his exploration seems to have taken place between the two visits of Stephens, as Bancroft
determines from a letter (April 21, 1841) written after the baron had started on his return voyage to Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>
In Paris, in October, 1841, under the introduction of Humboldt, Friederichsthal addressed the Academy, and
his paper was printed in the <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i> (xcii. 297) as “Les Monuments de l’Yucatan.”<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>
The camera was not, however, brought to the aid of the student with the most satisfactory results till
Charnay, in 1858, visited Izamal, Chichen-Itza, and Uxmal. He gave a foretaste of his results in the <i>Bulletin
de la Soc. de Géog</i>. (1861, vol. ii. 364), and in 1863 gave not very extended descriptions, relying mostly
on his <i>Atlas</i> of photographs in his <i>Cités et Ruines Américaines</i>, a part of which volume consists of the
architectural speculations of Viollet le Duc. Beside the farther studies of Charnay in his <i>Anciens Villes du
Nouveau Monde</i> (Paris, 1885), there have been recent explorations in Yucatan by Dr. Augustus Le Plongeon
and his wife, mainly at Chichen-Itza, in which for a while he had the aid and countenance of Mr. Stephen
Salisbury, Jr.,<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> of Worcester, Mass. Le Plongeon’s results are decidedly novel and helpful, but they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

<p>The principal ruins of Yucatan are those of Uxmal and Chichen-Itza, and references to the literature of
each will suffice. Those at Uxmal are in some respects distinct in character from the remains of Honduras
and of Chiapas. There are no idols as at Copan. There are no extensive stucco-work and no tablets as at
Palenqué. The general type is Cyclopean masonry, faced with dressed stones. The Casa de Monjas, or
nunnery (so called), is often considered the most remarkable ruin in Central America; and no architectural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

<p>The earliest printed account of Uxmal is in Cogolludo’s <i>Yucathan</i> (Madrid, 1688), pp. 176, 193, 197; but
it was well into this century before others were written. Lorenzo de Zavala gave but an outline account in his
<i>Notice</i>, printed in Dupaix in 1834. Waldeck (<i>Voyage Pitt.</i> 67, 93) spent eight days there in May, 1835, and
Stephens gives him the credit of being the earliest describer to attract attention. Stephens’s first visit in 1840
was hasty (<i>Cent. Amer.</i>, ii. 413), but on his second visit (1842) he took with him Waldeck’s <i>Voyage</i>, and his
description and the drawings of Catherwood were made with the advantage of having these earlier drawings
to compare. Stephens (<i>Yucatan</i>, i. 297) says that their plans and drawings differ materially from Waldeck’s;
but Bancroft, who compares the two, says that Stephens exaggerated the differences, which are not material,
except in a few plates (Stephens’s <i>Yucatan</i>, i. 163; ii. 264&mdash;ch. 24, 25). About the same time Norman and
Friederichsthal made their visits. Bancroft (iv. 150) refers to the lesser narratives of Carillo (1845), and
another, recorded in the <i>Registro Yucateco</i> (i. 273, 361), with Carl Bartholomæus Heller (April, 1847) in his
<i>Reisen in Mexico</i> (Leipzig, 1853). Charnay’s <i>Ruines</i> (p. 362), and his <i>Anciens Villes</i> (ch. 19, 20), record
visits in 1858 and later. Brasseur reported upon Uxmal in 1865 in the <i>Archives de la Com. Scientifique du
Méxique</i> (ii. 234, 254), and he had already made mention of them in his <i>Hist. Nations Civ.</i>, ii. ch. 1.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<p>The ruins of Chichen-Itza make part of the eastern group of the Yucatan remains. As was not the case
with some of the other principal ruins, the city in its prime has a record in Maya tradition; it was known
in the days of the Conquest, and has not been lost sight of since,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> though its ruins were not visited by explorers
till well within the present century, the first of whom, according to Stephens, was John Burke, in 1838.
Stephens had heard of them and mentioned them to Friederichsthal, who was there in 1840 (<i>Nouv. Annales
des Voyages</i>, xcii. 300-306). Norman was there
in February, 1842 (<i>Rambles</i>, 104), and did not
seem aware that any one had been there before
him; and Stephens himself, during the next
month (<i>Yucatan</i>, ii. 282), made the best record
which we have. Charnay made his observations
in 1858 (<i>Ruines</i>, 339,&mdash;cf. <i>Anciens
Villes</i>, ch. 18), and gives us nine good photographs.
The latest discoverer is Le Plongeon, whose investigations were signalized by the finding (1876) of
the statue of Chackmool, and by other notable researches (<i>Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1877; October, 1878).<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>It seems hardly to admit of doubt that the cities&mdash;if that be their proper designation&mdash;of Yucatan were
the work of the Maya people, whose descendants were found by the Spaniards in possession of the peninsula,
and that in some cases, like those of Uxmal and Toloom, their sacred edifices did not cease to be used till
some time after the Spaniards had possessed the country. Such were the conclusions of Stephens,<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> the sanest
mind that has spent its action upon these remains; and he tells us that a deed of the region where Uxmal is
situated, which passed in 1673, mentions the daily religious rites which the natives were then celebrating there,
and speaks of the swinging doors and cisterns then in use. The abandonment of one of the buildings, at least,
is brought down to within about two centuries, and comparisons of Catherwood’s drawings with the descriptions
of more recent explorers, by showing a very marked deterioration within a comparatively few years,
enable us easily to understand how the piercing roots of a rapidly growing vegetation can make a greater havoc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in a century than will occur in temperate climates. The preservation of paint on the walls, and of wooden lintels
in some places, also induce a belief that no great time, such as would imply an extinct race of builders, is
necessary to account for the present condition of the ruins, and we must always remember how the Spaniards
used them as quarries for building their neighboring towns. How long these habitations and shrines stood in
their perfection is a question about which archæologists have had many and diverse estimates, ranging from
hundreds to thousands of years. There is nothing in the ruins themselves to settle the question, beyond a
study of their construction. So far as the traditionary history of the Mayas can determine, some of them may
have been built between the third and the tenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p class="p2">We come now to Chiapas. The age of the ruins of Palenqué<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> can only be conjectured, and very indefinitely,
though perhaps there is not much risk in saying that they represent some of the oldest architectural structures
known in the New World, and were very likely abandoned three or four centuries before the coming of the
Spaniards. Still, any confident statement is unwise. Perhaps there may be some fitness in Brasseur’s belief
that the stucco additions and roofs were the work of a later people than those who laid the foundations.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> Bancroft
(iv. 289) has given the fullest account of the literature describing these ruins. They seem to have been
first found in 1750, or a few years before. The report reaching Ramon de Ordoñez, then a boy, was not forgotten
by him, and prompted him to send his brother in 1773 to explore them. Among the manuscripts in
the Brasseur Collection (<i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>, p. 113; Pinart, no. 695) are a <i>Memoria relativa à las ruinas...
de Palenqué</i>, and <i>Notas de Chiapas y Palenqué</i>, which are supposed to be the record of this exploration written
by Ramon, as copied from the original in the Museo Nacional, and which, in part at least, constituted the
report which Ramon made in 1784 to the president of the Audiencia Real. Ramon’s view was that he had hit
upon the land of Ophir, and the country visited by the Phœnicians. This same president now directed José
Antonio Calderon to visit the ruins, and we have his “Informe” translated in Brasseur’s <i>Palenqué</i> (introd.
p. 5). From February to June of 1785, Antonio Benasconi, the royal architect of Guatemala, inspected the
ruins under similar orders. His report, as well as the preceding one, with the accompanying drawings, were
dispatched to Spain, where J. B. Muñoz made a summary of them for the king. I do not find any of them
have been printed. The result of the royal interest in the matter was, that Antonio del Rio was next commissioned
to make a more thorough survey, which he accomplished (May-June, 1787) with the aid of a band of
natives to fell the trees and fire the rubbish. He broke through the walls in a reckless way, that added greatly
to the devastation of years. Rio’s report, dated at Palenqué June 24, 1787, was published first in 1855, in the
<i>Diccionario Univ. de Geog.</i>, viii. 528.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> Meanwhile, beside the copy of the manuscript sent to Spain, other
manuscripts were kept in Guatemala and Mexico; and one of these falling into the hands of a Dr. M’Quy, was
taken to England and translated under the title <i>Description of the Ruins of an Ancient City discovered near
Palenque in Guatemala, Spanish America, translated from the Original MS. Report of Capt. Don A. Del
Rio; followed by Teatro Critico Americano, or a Critical Investigation and Research into the History of

<p>The results of the explorations of Dupaix, made early in the present century by order of Carlos IV. of Spain,
long remained unpublished. His report and the drawings of Castañeda lay uncared for in the Mexican archives
during the period of the Revolution. Latour Allard, of Paris, obtained copies of some of the drawings,
and from these Kingsborough got copies, which he engraved for his <i>Mexican Antiquities</i>, in which Dupaix’s
report was also printed in Spanish and English (vols. iv., v., vi.). It is not quite certain whether the originals
or copies were delivered (1828) by the Mexican authorities to Baradère, who a few years later secured their
publication with additional matter as <i>Antiquités méxicaines</i>. <i>Relation des trois expéditions du capitaine
Dupaix, ordonnées en 1805, 1806 et 1807, pour la recherche des antiquités du pays, notamment celles de
Mitla et de Palenque; accompagnée des dessins de Castañeda, et d’une carte du pays exploré; suivie d’un
parallèle de ces monuments avec ceux de l’Égypte, de l’Indostan, et du reste de l’ancien monde par Alexandre
Lenoir; d’une dissertation sur l’origine de l’ancienne population des deux Amériques par [D. B.]
Warden; avec un discours préliminaire par. M. Charles Farcy, et des notes explicatives, et autres documents

are superior to those in Kingsborough and in Rio; and are indeed improved in the engraving over Castañeda’s
drawings. The book as a whole is one of the most important on Palenqué which we have. The investigations
were made on his third expedition (1807-8). A tablet taken from the ruins by him is in the Museo
Nacional, and a cast of it is figured in the <i>Numis. and Antiq. Soc. of Philad. Proc.</i>, Dec. 4, 1884.</p>

<p>During the twenty-five years next following Dupaix, we find two correspondents of the French and English
Geographical Societies supplying their publications with occasional accounts of their observations among the
ruins. One of them, Dr. F. Corroy,<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> was then living at Tabasco; the other, Col. Juan Gallindo,<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> was resident
in the country as an administrative officer.</p>

        <p class="pf400">These slabs, six feet high, were taken from Palenqué, and when Stephens saw them they were in private hands at
San Domingo, near by, but later they were placed in the church front in the same town, and here Charnay took impressions
of them, from which they were engraved in <i>The Ancient Cities</i>, etc., p. 217, and copied thence in the above cuts.
This same type of head is considered by Rosny the Aztec head of Palenqué (<i>Doc. écrits de la Antiq. Amer.</i>, 73), and as
belonging to the superior classes. In order to secure the convex curve of the nose and forehead an ornament was sometimes
added, as shown in a head of the second tablet at Palenqué, and in the photograph of a bas-relief, preserved in the
Museo Archeologico at Madrid, given by Rosny (vol. 3), and hypothetically called by him a statue of Cuculkan. This
ornament is not infrequently seen in other images of this region.</p>
<p class="pf400">Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i>, ii. 126), speaking of the tablet of the Cross of Palenqué, says: “These tablets and

strong approach to identity.”</p>

<p>Fréderic de Waldeck, the artist who some years before had familiarized himself with the character of the
ruins in the preparation of the engravings for Rio’s work, was employed in 1832-34. He was now considerably
over sixty years of age, and under the pay of a committee, which had raised a subscription, in which the
Mexican government shared. He made the most thorough examination of Palenqué which has yet been made.
Waldeck was a skilful artist, and his drawings are exquisite; but he was not free from a tendency to improve
or restore, where the conditions gave a hint, and so as we have them in the final publication they have not been
accepted as wholly trustworthy. He made more than 200 drawings, and either the originals or copies&mdash;Stephens
says “copies,” the originals being confiscated&mdash;were taken to Europe. Waldeck announced his
book in Paris, and the public had already had a taste of his not very sober views in some communications
which he had sent in Aug. and Nov., 1832, to the Société de Géographie de Paris. Long years of delay followed,
and Waldeck had lived to be over ninety, when the French government bought his collection<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> (in 1860),
and made preparations for its publication. Out of the 188 drawings thus secured, 56 were selected and were
admirably engraved, and only that portion of Waldeck’s text was preserved which was purely descriptive,
and not all of that. Selection was made of Brasseur de Bourbourg, who at that time had never visited the
ruins,<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> to furnish some introductory matter. This he prepared in an <i>Avant-propos</i>, recapitulating the progress
of such studies; and this was followed by an <i>Introduction aux Ruines de Palenqué</i>, narrating the course of
explorations up to that time; a section also published separately as <i>Recherches sur les Ruines de Palenqué
et sur les origines de la civilisation du Méxique</i> (Paris, 1886), and finally Waldeck’s own <i>Description des
Ruines</i>, followed by the plates, most of which relate to Palenqué. Thus composed, a large volume was published
under the general title of <i>Monuments anciens du Méxique</i>. <i>Palenqué et autres ruines de l’ancienne
civilisation du Méxique. Collection de vues [etc.], cartes et plans dessinés d’après nature et relevés par M.
de Waldeck. Texte rédigé par M. Brasseur de Bourbourg.</i> (Paris, 1864-1866.)<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> While Waldeck’s results
were still unpublished the ruins of Palenqué were brought most effectively to the attention of the English
reader in the <i>Travels in Central America</i> (vol. ii. ch. 17) of Stephens, which was illustrated by the drawings
of Catherwood,<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> since famous. These better cover the field, and are more exact than those of Dupaix.</p>

<p>Bancroft refers to an anonymous account in the <i>Registro Yucateco</i> (i. 318). One of the most intelligent of
the later travellers is Arthur Morelet, who privately printed his <i>Voyage dans l’Amérique Central, Cuba et le
Yucatan</i>, which includes an account of a fortnight’s stay at Palenqué. His results would be difficult of access<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

<p>Désiré Charnay was the first to bring photography to the aid of the student when he visited Palenqué in
1858, and his plates forming the folio atlas accompanying his <i>Cités et Ruines Américaines</i> (1863), pp. 72, 411,
are, as Bancroft (iv. 293) points out, of interest to enable us to test the drawings of preceding delineators, and
to show how time had acted on the ruins since the visit of Stephens. His later results are recorded in his

<p>There have been only two statues found at Palenqué, in connection with the T

have made in some respects these most
celebrated of the Honduras remains more interesting
than those of Chiapas. It is now
generally agreed that the ruins of Copan<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> do
not represent the town called Copan, assaulted
and captured by Hernando de Choves in 1530,
though the identity of names has induced
some writers to claim that these ruins were
inhabited when the Spaniards came.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> The
earliest account of them which we have is that
in Palacio’s letter to Felipe II., written (1576)
hardly more than a generation after the Conquest,
and showing that the ruins then were
much in the same condition as later described.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>
The next account is that of Fuentes y Guzman’s
<i>Historia de Guatemala</i> (1689), now
accessible in the Madrid edition of 1882; but
for a long time only known in the citation in
Juarros’ <i>Guatemala</i> (p. 56), and through those
who had copied from Juarros.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> His account
is brief, speaks of Castilian costumes, and is
otherwise so enigmatical that Brasseur calls
it mendacious. Colonel Galindo, in visiting
the ruins in 1836, confounded them with the
Copan of the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> The ruins also came
Under the scrutiny of Stephens in 1839, and
they were described by him, and drawn by
Catherwood, for the first time with any fullness
and care, in their respective works.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Always associated with Copan, and perhaps

the most extensive account of them which we have, in his <i>Ein Besuch bei den Ruinen von Quiriguá</i>

must not forget that some of these writings were made after the Conquest, and were influenced in some
degree by Spanish associations. Of this last class were land titles and catechisms, for the native system

helping the instruction by the priests.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<p>It is usual in tracing the development of a hieroglyphic system to advance from a purely figurative one&mdash;in
which pictures of objects are used&mdash;through a symbolic phase; in which such pictures are interpreted conventionally
instead of realistically. It was to this last stage that the Aztecs had advanced; but they mingled
the two methods, and apparently varied in the order of reading, whether by lines or columns, forwards, upwards,
or backwards. The difficulty of understanding them is further increased by the same object holding
different meanings in different connections, and still more by the personal element, or writer’s style, as we
should call it, which was impressed on his choice of objects and emblems.<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> This rendered interpretation by no
means easy to the aborigines themselves, and we have statements that when native documents were referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to them it required sometimes long consultations to reach a common understanding.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> The additional step
by which objects stand for sounds, the Aztecs seem not to have taken, except in the names of persons and
places, in which they understood the modern child’s art of the rebus, where such symbol more or less clearly
stands for a syllable, and the representation was usually of conventionalized forms, somewhat like the art
of the European herald. Thus the Aztec system was what Daniel Wilson<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> calls “the pictorial suggestion of

the Maya hieroglyphics, and this was the great distinctive feature of the latter, as we learn from the early
descriptions,<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> and from the alphabet which Landa has preserved for us. It is not only in the codices or

<p>When the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg found, in 1863, in the library of the Royal Academy of History at
Madrid, the MS. of Landa’s <i>Relacion</i>, and discovered in it what purported to be a key to the Maya alphabet,
there were hopes that the interpretation of the Maya books and inscriptions was not far off. Twenty-five
years, however, has not seen the progress that was wished for; and if we may believe Valentini, the alphabet
of Landa is a pure fabrication of the bishop himself;<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> and even some of those who account it genuine, like Le
Plongeon, hold that it is inadequate in dealing with the older Maya inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> Cyrus Thomas speaks of
this alphabet as simply an attempt of the bishop to pick out of compound characters their simple elements
on the supposition that something like phonetic representations would be the result.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> Landa’s own description<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>
of the alphabet accompanying his graphic key<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> is very unsatisfactory, not to say incomprehensible.
Brasseur has tried to render it in French, and Bancroft in English; but it remains a difficult problem to interpret
it intelligibly.</p>

<p>Brasseur very soon set himself the task of interpreting the Troano manuscript by the aid of this key, and
he soon had the opportunity of giving his interpretation to the public when the Emperor Napoleon III. ordered
that codex to be printed in the sumptuous manner of the imperial press.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> The efforts of Brasseur met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with hardly a sign of approval. Léon de Rosny criticised him,<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> and Dr. Brinton found in his results nothing
to commend.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>No one has approached the question of interpreting these Maya writings with more careful scrutiny than
Léon de Rosny, who first attracted attention with his
comparative study, <i>Les écritures figuratives et hiéroglyphiques
des différens peuples anciens et moderns</i> (Paris,
1860; again, 1870, augmentée). From 1869 to 1871 he
published at Paris four parts of <i>Archives paléographiques
de l’Orient et de l’Amérique, publiées avec des notices
historiques et philologiques</i>, in which he included several
studies of the native writings, and gave a bibliography
(pp. 101-115) of American paleography up to that time.
His <i>L’interprétation des anciens textes Mayas</i> made part
of the first volume of the <i>Archives de la Soc. Américaine
de France</i> (new series). His chief work, making
the second volume of the same, is his <i>Essai sur le déchiffrement
de l’écriture hiératique de l’Amérique Central</i>
(Paris, 1876), and it is the most thorough examination
of the problem yet made.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> The last part (4th) was
published in 1878, and a Spanish translation appeared in
1881.</p>

(b. 1795, d. 1837). It was while, as Edward King, he was a student at Oxford that this nobleman’s passion for
Mexican antiquities was first roused by seeing an original Aztec pictograph, described by Purchas (<i>Pilgrimes</i>,
vol. iii.), and preserved in the Bodleian. In the studies to which this led he was assisted by some special
scholars, including Obadiah Rich, who searched for him in Spain in 1830 and 1832, and who after Kingsborough’s
death obtained a large part of the manuscript collections which that nobleman had amassed (<i>Catalogue
of the Sale</i>, Dublin, 1842). Many of the Kingsborough manuscripts passed into the collection of Sir Thomas
Phillipps (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 404), but the correspondence pertaining to Kingsborough’s life-work seems to have
disappeared. Phillipps had been one of the main encouragers of Kingsborough in his undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> Kingsborough,

<p>Kingsborough’s great work, the most sumptuous yet bestowed upon Mexican archæology, was published
between 1830 and 1848, there being an interval of seventeen years between the seventh and eighth volumes.
The original intention seems to have embraced ten volumes, for the final section of the ninth volume is signatured

of the Institute of Bologna; and in the Bodleian Library at Oxford; together with the Monuments of New
Spain, by M. Dupaix; illustrated by many valuable inedited MSS</i>. With the theory maintained by Kingsborough
throughout the work, that the Jews were the first colonizers of the country, we have nothing to do here;
but as the earliest and as yet the largest repository of hieroglyphic material, the book needs to be examined.
The compiler states where he found his MSS., but he gives nothing of their history, though something more
is now known of their descent. Peter Martyr speaks of the number of Mexican MSS. which had in his day
been taken to Spain, and Prescott remarks it as strange that not a single one given by Kingsborough was
found in that country. There are, however, some to be seen there now.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Comparisons which have been made

<p>Kingsborough’s first volume opens with a fac-simile of what is usually called the <i>Codex Mendoza</i>, preserved in
the Bodleian. It is, however, a contemporary copy on European paper of an original now lost, which was sent
by the Viceroy Mendoza to Charles V. Another copy made part of the Boturini collection, and from this

is, that on its passage to Europe it was captured by a French cruiser and taken to Paris, where it was

<p>The third volume reproduces one belonging to the Borgian Museum at Rome, written on skin, and thought
to be a ritual and astrological almanac. This is accompanied by a commentary by Frabega.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> Kingsborough
gives but a single Maya MS., and this is in his third volume, and stands with him as an Aztec production.
This is the <i>Dresden Codex</i>, not very exactly rendered, which is preserved in the royal library in that city, for
which it was bought by Götz,<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> at Vienna, in 1739. Prescott (i. 107) seemed to recognize its difference from
the Aztec MSS., without knowing precisely how to class it.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> Brasseur de Bourbourg calls it a religious and
astrological ritual. It is in two sections, and it is not certain that they belong together. In 1880 it was reproduced
at Dresden by polychromatic photography (Chromo-Lichtdruck), as the process is called, under the
editing of Dr. E. Förstemann, who in an introduction describes it as composed of thirty-nine oblong sheets
folded together like a fan. They are made of the bark of a tree, and covered with varnish. Thirty-five have
drawings and hieroglyphics on both sides; the other four on one side only. It is now preserved between glass
to prevent handling, and both sides can be examined. Some progress has been made, it is professed, in deciphering
its meaning, and it is supposed to contain “records of a mythic, historic, and ritualistic character.”<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p>Another script in Kingsborough, perhaps a Tezcucan MS., though having some Maya affinities, is the
<i>Fejérvary Codex</i>, then preserved in Hungary, and lately owned by Mayer, of Liverpool.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p>Three other Maya manuscripts have been brought to light since Kingsborough’s day, to say nothing of three
others said to be in private hands, and not described.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> Of these, the <i>Codex Troano</i> has been the subject of
much study. It is the property of a Madrid gentleman, Don Juan Tro y Ortolano, and the title given to the
manuscript has been somewhat fantastically formed from his name by the Abbé Etienne Charles Brasseur
de Bourbourg, who was instrumental in its recognition about 1865 or 1866, and who edited a sumptuous two-volume
folio edition with chromo-lithographic plates.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a></p>

<p>While Léon de Rosny was preparing his <i>Essai
sur le déchiffrement de l’Ecriture hiératique</i>
(1876), a Maya manuscript was offered to the
Bibliothèque Impériale in Paris and declined, because
the price demanded was too high. Photographic
copies of two of its leaves had been submitted,
and one of these is given by Rosny in the
<i>Essai</i> (pl. xi.). The Spanish government finally
bought the MS., which, because it was supposed
to have once belonged to Cortes, is now known as
the <i>Codex Cortesianus</i>. Rosny afterwards saw
it and studied it in the Museo Archeológico at
Madrid, as he makes known in his <i>Doc. Ecrits
de la Antiq. Amér.</i>, p. 79, where he points out
the complementary character of one of its leaves
with another of the MS. Troano, showing them
to belong together, and gives photographs of the
two (pl. v. vi.), as well as of other leaves (pl. 8 and
9). The part of this codex of a calendar character
(Tableau des Bacab) is reproduced from Rosny’s
plate by Cyrus Thomas<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> in an essay in the <i>Third
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology</i>, together
with an attempted restoration of the plate, which
is obscure in parts. Finally a small edition (85
copies) of the entire MS. was published at Paris
in 1883.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p>The last of the Maya MSS. recently brought
to light is sometimes cited as the <i>Codex Perezianus</i>,
because the paper in which it was wrapped,
when recognized in 1859 by Rosny,<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> bore the
name “Perez”; and sometimes designated as
Codex Mexicanus, or Manuscrit Yucatèque No.
2, of the National Library at Paris. It was a
few years later published as <i>Manuscrit dit

<p class="pc elarge">THE INCA CIVILIZATION IN PERU.</p>

<p class="pc">BY CLEMENTS R. MARKHAM, C. B.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE civilization of the Incas of Peru is the most important, because
it is the highest, phase in the development of progress among the
American races. It represents the combined efforts, during long periods,
of several peoples who eventually became welded into one nation. The
especial interest attaching to the study of this civilization consists in the
fact that it was self-developed, and that, so far as can be ascertained, it
received no aid and no impulse from foreign contact.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to bear in mind that the empire of the Incas,
in its final development, was formed of several nations which had, during
long periods, worked out their destinies apart from each other; and that
one, at least, appears to have been entirely distinct from the Incas in race
and language.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> These facts must be carefully borne in mind in pursuing
inquiries relating to the history of Inca civilization. It is also essential
that the nature and value of the evidence on which conclusions must be
based should be understood and carefully weighed. This evidence is of
several kinds. Besides the testimony of Spanish writers who witnessed the
conquest of Peru, or who lived a generation afterwards, there is the evidence
derived from a study of the characteristics of descendants of the Inca people,
of their languages and literature, and of their architectural and other
remains. These various kinds of evidence must be compared, their respective
values must be considered, and thus alone, in our time, can the nearest
approximation to the truth be reached.</p>

<p>The testimony of writers in the sixteenth century, who had the advantage
of being able to see the workings of Inca institutions, to examine the outcome
of their civilization in all its branches, and to converse with the Incas
themselves respecting the history and the traditions of their people, is the
most important evidence. Much of this testimony has been preserved, but
unfortunately a great deal is lost. The sack of Cadiz by the Earl of Essex,
in 1595, was the occasion of the loss of Blas Valera’s priceless work.<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> Other

through neglect and carelessness. Authors are mentioned, or even quoted,
whose books have disappeared. The contemplation of the fallen Inca
empire excited the curiosity and interest of a great number of intelligent
men among the Spanish conquerors. Many wrote narratives of what they
saw and heard. A few studied the language and traditions of the people
with close attention. And these authors were not confined to the clerical
and legal professions; they included several of the soldier-conquerors themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>The nature of the country and climate was a potent agent in forming the
character of the people, and in enabling them to make advances in civilization.
In the dense forests of the Amazonian valleys, in the boundless
prairies and savannas, we only meet with wandering tribes of hunters and
fishers. It is on the lofty plateaux of the Andes, where extensive tracts of
land are adapted for tillage, or in the comparatively temperate valleys of
the western coast, that we find nations advanced in civilization.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p>The region comprised in the empire of the Incas during its greatest
extension is bounded on the east by the forest-covered Amazonian plains,
on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and its length along the line of the Cordilleras
was upwards of 1,500 miles, from 2° N. to 20° S. This vast tract
comprises every temperature and every variety of physical feature. The inhabitants
of the plains and valleys of the Andes enjoyed a temperate and
generally bracing climate, and their energies were called forth by the physical
difficulties which had to be overcome through their skill and hardihood.
Such a region was suited for the gradual development of a vigorous race,
capable of reaching to a high state of culture. The different valleys and
plateaux are separated by lofty mountain chains or by profound gorges, so
that the inhabitants would, in the earliest period of their history, make their
own slow progress in comparative isolation, and would have little intercommunication.
When at last they were brought together as one people, and
thus combined their efforts in forming one system, it is likely that such a
union would have a tendency to be of long duration, owing to the great
difficulties which must have been overcome in its creation. On the other
hand, if, in course of time, disintegration once began, it might last long, and
great efforts would be required to build up another united empire. The
evidence seems to point to the recurrence of these processes more than
once, in the course of ages, and to their commencement in a very remote
antiquity.</p>

<p>One strong piece of evidence pointing to the great length of time during
which the Inca nations had been a settled and partially civilized race, is to
be found in the plants that had been brought under cultivation, and in the
animals that had been domesticated. Maize is unknown in a wild state,<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and many centuries must have elapsed before the Peruvians could have produced
numerous cultivated varieties, and have brought the plant to such a
high state of perfection. The peculiar edible roots, called <i>oca</i> and <i>aracacha</i>,
also exist only as cultivated plants. There is no wild variety of the <i>chirimoya</i>,
and the Peruvian species
of the cotton plant is
known only under cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>
The potato is found
wild in Chile, and probably in
Peru, as a very insignificant
tuber. But the Peruvians,
after cultivating it for centuries,
increased its size and
produced a great number of
edible varieties.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> Another
proof of the great antiquity of
Peruvian civilization is to be
found in the llama and alpaca,
which are domesticated
animals, with individuals varying in color: the one a beast of burden yielding
coarse wool, and the other bearing a thick fleece of the softest silken
fibres. Their prototypes are the wild huanaco and vicuña, of uniform
color, and untameable. Many centuries must have elapsed before the wild
creatures of the Andean solitudes, with the habits of chamois, could have
been converted into the Peruvian sheep which cannot exist apart from men.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a></p>

<p>These considerations point to so vast a period during which the existing
race had dwelt in the Peruvian Andes, that any speculation respecting its
origin would necessarily be futile in the present state of our knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>
The weight of tradition indicates the south as the quarter whence the
people came whose descendants built the edifices at Tiahuanacu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The most ancient remains of a primitive people in the Peruvian Andes
consist of rude <i>cromlechs</i>, or burial-places, which are met with in various
localities. Don Modesto Basadre has described some by the roadside, in
the descent from Umabamba to Charasani, in Bolivia. These cromlechs are
formed of four great slabs of slate, each slab being about five feet high, four
or five in width, and more than an inch thick. The four slabs are perfectly
shaped and worked so as to fit into each other at the corners. A fifth slab
is placed over them, and over the whole a pyramid of clay and rough stones
is piled. These cromlechs are the early memorials of a race which was succeeded
by the people who constructed the cyclopean edifices of the Andean
plateaux.</p>

<p>For there is reason to believe that a powerful empire had existed in Peru
centuries before the rise of the Inca dynasty. Cyclopean ruins, quite foreign
to the genius of Inca architecture, point to this conclusion. The wide
area over which they are found is an indication that the government which
caused them to be built ruled over an extensive empire, while their cyclopean
character is a proof that their projectors had an almost unlimited supply
of labor. Religious myths and dynastic traditions throw some doubtful
light on that remote past, which has left its silent memorials in the huge
stones of Tiahuanacu, Sacsahuaman, and Ollantay, and in the altar of Concacha.</p>

<p>They consist of a quadrangular space, entered
by the famous monolithic doorway, and surrounded by large stones
standing on end; and of a hill or mound encircled by remains of a wall,
consisting of enormous blocks of stone. The whole covers an area about
400 yards long by 350 broad. There is a lesser temple, about a quarter of
a mile distant, containing stones 36 feet long by 7, and 26 by 16, with
recesses in them which have been compared to seats of judgment. The
weight of the two great stones has been estimated at from 140 to 200 tons
each, and the distance of the quarries whence they could have been brought
is from 15 to 40 miles.</p>

<p>In the centre there is a figure carved in high relief, in an oblong compartment,
2 ft. 2 in. long by 1 ft. 6 in.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> Squier describes this figure as
angularly but boldly cut. The head is surrounded by rays, each terminating
in a circle or the head of an animal. The breast is adorned with two
serpents united by a square band. Another band, divided into ornamented
compartments, passes round the neck, and the ends are brought down to
the girdle, from which hang six human heads. Human heads also hang
from the elbows, and the hands clasp sceptres which terminate in the heads
of condors. The legs are cut off near the girdle, and below there are a
series of frieze-like ornaments, each ending with a condor’s head. On
either side of this central sculpture there are three tiers of figures, 16 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
each tier, or 48 in all, each in a kneeling posture, and facing towards the
large central figure. Each figure is in a square, the sides of which measure
eight inches. All are winged, and hold sceptres ending in condors’ heads;
but while those in the upper and lower tiers have crowned human heads, those
in the central tier have the heads of condors. There is a profusion of ornament
on all these figures, consisting of heads of birds and fishes. An ornamental
frieze runs along the base of the lowest tier of figures, consisting of
an elaborate pattern of angular lines ending in condors’ heads, with larger
human heads surrounded by rays, in the intervals of the pattern. Cieza de
Leon and Alcobasa<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> mention that, besides this sculpture over the doorway,
there were richly carved statues at Tiahuanacu, which have since been destroyed,
and many cylindrical pillars with capitals. The head of one statue,
with a peculiar head-dress, which is 3 ft. 6 in. long, still lies by the roadside.</p>

<p>The masonry of the ruins is admirably worked, according to the testimony
of all visitors. Squier says: “The stone itself is a dark and exceedingly
hard trachyte. It is faced with a precision that no skill can excel.
Its lines are perfectly drawn, and its right angles turned with an accuracy
that the most careful geometer could not surpass. I do not believe there
exists a better piece of stone-cutting, the material considered, on this or
the other continent.”</p>

<p>It is desirable to describe these ruins, and especially the sculpture over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the monolithic doorway, with some minuteness, because, with the probable
exception of the cromlechs, they are the most ancient, and, without any
exception, the most interesting that have been met with in Peru. There is
nothing elsewhere that at all resembles the sculpture on the monolithic
doorway at Tiahuanacu.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> The central figure, with rows of kneeling worshippers
on either side, all covered with symbolic designs, represents, it
may be conjectured, either the sovereign and his vassals, or, more probably,
the Deity, with representatives of all the nations bowing down before him.
The sculpture and the most ancient traditions should throw light upon each
other.</p>

<p>Further north there are other examples of prehistoric cyclopean remains.
Such is the great wall, with its “stone of 12 corners,” in the Calle del Triunfo
at Cuzco. Such is the famous fortress of Cuzco, on the Sacsahuaman
Hill. Such, too, are portions of the ruins at Ollantay-tampu. Still farther
north there are cyclopean ruins at Concacha, at Huiñaque, and at Huaraz.</p>

of its symbolic sculpture may throw glimmerings of light on remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
history; but Sacsahuaman, the fortress overlooking the city of Cuzco, is,
without comparison, the grandest monument of an ancient civilization in
the New World. Like the Pyramids and the Coliseum, it is imperishable.
It consists of a fortified work 600 yards in length, built of gigantic stones,
in three lines, forming walls supporting terraces and parapets arranged in
salient and retiring angles. This work defends the only assailable side of a
position which is impregnable, owing to the steepness of the ascent in all
other directions. The outer wall averages a height of 26 feet. Then there
is a terrace 16 yards across, whence the second wall rises to 18 feet. The
second terrace is six yards across, and the third wall averages a height of
12 feet. The total height of the fortification is 56 feet. The stones are of
blue limestone, of enormous size and irregular in shape, but fitted into each
other with rare precision. One of the stones is 27 feet high by 14, and
stones 15 feet high by 12 are common throughout the work.</p>

<p>At Ollantay-tampu the ruins are of various styles, but the later works
are raised on ancient cyclopean foundations.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> There are six porphyry slabs
12 feet high by 6 or 7; stone beams 15 and 20 feet long; stairs and
recesses hewn out of the solid rock. Here, as at Tiahuanacu, there were,
according to Cieza de Leon,<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> men and animals carved on the stones, but
they have disappeared. The same style of architecture, though only in
fragments, is met with further north.</p>

<p>East of the river Apurimac, and not far from the town of Abancay, there
are three groups of ancient monuments in a deep valley surrounded by
lofty spurs of the Andes. There is a great cyclopean wall, a series of seats
or thrones of various forms hewn out of the solid stone, and a huge block
carved on five sides, called the <i>Rumi-huasi</i>. The northern face of this
monolith is cut into the form of a staircase; on the east there are two enormous
seats separated by thick partitions, and on the south there is a sort of
lookout place, with a seat. Collecting channels traverse the block, and join
trenches or grooves leading to two deep excavations on the western side.
On this western side there is also a series of steps, apparently for the fall
of a cascade of water connected with the sacrificial rites. Molina gives a
curious account of the water sacrifices of the Incas.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> The <i>Rumi-huasi</i> seems
to have been the centre of a great sanctuary, and to have been used as an
altar. Its surface is carved with animals amidst a labyrinth of cavities and
partition ridges. Its length is 20 feet by 14 broad, and 12 feet high. Here
we have, no doubt, a sacrificial altar of the ancient people, on which the
blood of animals and libations of <i>chicha</i> flowed in torrents.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<p>Spanish writers received statements from the Indians that one or other
of these cyclopean ruins was built by some particular Inca. Garcilasso de
la Vega even names the architects of the Cuzco fortress. But it is clear
from the evidence of the most careful investigators, such as Cieza de Leon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that there was no real knowledge of their origin, and that memory of the
builders was either quite lost, or preserved in vague, uncertain traditions.</p>

<p>The most ancient myth points to the region of Lake Titicaca as the
scene of the creative operations of a Deity, or miracle-working Lord.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> This
Deity is said to have created the sun, moon, and stars, or to have caused
them to rise out of Lake Titicaca. He also created men of stone at Tiahuanacu,
or of clay; making them pass under the earth, and appear again out
of caves, tree-trunks, rocks, or fountains in the different provinces which
were to be peopled by their descendants. But this seems to be a later attempt
to reconcile the ancient Titicaca myth with the local worship of natural objects
as ancestors or founders of their race, among the numerous subjugated
tribes; as well as to account for the colossal statues of unknown origin at
Tiahuanacu. There are variations of the story, but there is general concurrence
in the main points: that the Deity created the heavenly bodies and
the human race, and that the ancient people, or their rulers, were called
<i>Pirua</i>. Tradition also seems to point to regions south of the lake as the
quarter whence the first settlers came who worked out the earliest civilization.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a>
We may, in accordance with all the indications that are left to us,
connect the great god <i>Illa Ticsi</i> with the central figure of the Tiahuanacu
sculpture, and the kneeling worshippers with the rulers of all the nations and
tribes which had been subjugated by the <i>Hatun-runa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>&mdash;the great men
who had Pirua for their king, and who originally came from the distant
south. The Piruas governed a vast empire, erected imperishable cyclopean
edifices, and developed a complicated civilization, which is dimly indicated
to us by the numerous symbolical sculptures on the monolith. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
also, in a long course of years, brought wild plants under cultivation, and
domesticated the animals of the lofty Andean plateau. But it is remarkable
that the shores of Lake Titicaca, which are almost treeless, and where corn
will not ripen, should have been chosen as the centre of this most ancient
civilization. Yet the ruins of Tiahuanacu conclusively establish the fact
that the capital of the Piruas was on the loftiest site ever selected for the
seat of a great empire.</p>

<p>The Amautas, or learned men of the later Inca period, preserved the
names of sovereigns of the Pirua dynasty, commencing with Pirua Manco,
and continuing for sixty-five generations. Lopez conjectures that there
was a change of dynasty after the eighteenth Pirua king, because hitherto
Montesinos, who has recorded the list, had always called each successor son
and heir, but after the eighteenth only heir. Hence he thinks that a new
dynasty of Amautas, or kings of the learned caste, succeeded the Piruas.
The only deeds recorded of this long line of kings are their success in
repelling invasions and their alterations of the calendar. At length there
appears to have been a general disruption of the empire: Cuzco was nearly
deserted, rebel leaders rose up in all directions, the various tribes became
independent, and the chief who claimed to be the representative of the old
dynasties was reduced to a small territory to the south of Cuzco, in the
valley of the Vilcamayu, and was called “King of Tampu Tocco.” This
state of disintegration is said to have continued for twenty-eight generations,
at the end of which time a new empire began to be consolidated under
the Incas, which inherited the civilization and traditions of the ancient
dynasties, and succeeded to their power and dominion.</p>

<p>It was long believed that the lists of kings of the earlier dynasties rested
solely on the authority of Montesinos, and they consequently received little
credit. But recent research has brought to light the work of another writer,
who studied before Montesinos, and who incidentally refers to two of the
sovereigns in his lists.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> This furnishes independent evidence that the
catalogues of early kings had been preserved orally or by means of <i>quipus</i>,
and that they were in existence when the Spaniards conquered Peru; thus
giving weight to the testimony of Montesinos.</p>

<p>The second myth of the Peruvians refers to the origin of the Incas, who
derived their descent from the kings of Tampu Tocco, and had their original
home at Paccari-tampu, in the valley of the Vilcamayu, south of Cuzco. It
is, therefore, an ancestral myth. It is related that four brothers, with their
four sisters, issued forth from apertures (<i>Tocco</i>) in a cave at Paccari-tampu,
a name which means “the abode of dawn.” The brothers were called Ayar
Manco, Ayar Cachi, Ayar Uchu, and Ayar Sauca, names to which the
Incas, in the time of Garcilasso de la Vega, gave a fanciful meaning.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of the brothers showed extraordinary prowess in hurling a stone from a
sling. The others became jealous, and, persuading Ayar Auca, the expert
slingsman, to return into the cave, they blocked the entrance with rocks.
Ayar Uchu was converted into a stone idol, on the summit of a hill near
Cuzco, called Huanacauri. Manco then advanced to Cuzco with his youngest
brother, and found that the place was occupied by a chief named Alcaviza
and his people. Here Manco established the seat of his government,
and the Alcaviza tribe appears to have submitted to him, and to have lived
side by side with the Incas for some generations. The Huanacauri hill
was considered the most sacred place in Peru; while the <i>Tampu-tocco</i>, or
cave at Paccari-tampu, was, through the piety of descendants, faced with a
masonry wall, having three windows lined with plates of gold.</p>

<p>There is a third myth which seems to connect the ancient tradition of
Titicaca with the ancestral myth of the Incas. It is said that long after
the creation by the Deity, a great and beneficent being appeared at Tiahuanacu,
who divided the world among four kings: Manco Ccapac, Colla, Tocay<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>
or Tocapo,<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> and Pinahua.<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> The names Tuapaca, Arnauan,<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> Tonapa,<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
and Tarapaca occur in connection with this being, while some authorities
tell us that his name was unknown. Betanzos says that he went from Titicaca
to Cuzco, where he set up a chief named Alcaviza, and that he advanced
through the country until he disappeared over the sea at Puerto
Viejo. It is also related that the people of Canas attacked him, but were
converted by a miracle, and that they built a great temple, with an image,
at Cacha, in honor of this being, or of his god Illa Ticsi Uira-cocha. This
temple now forms a ruin which in its structure and arrangement is unique
in Peru, and therefore deserves special attention.</p>

<p>The ruins of the temple of Cacha are in the valley of the Vilcamayu,
south of Cuzco. They were described by Garcilasso de la Vega, and have
been visited and carefully examined by Squier. The main temple was 330
feet long by 87 broad, with wrought-stone walls and a steep pitched roof.
A high wall extended longitudinally through the centre of the structure,
consisting of a wrought-stone foundation, 8 feet high and 5½ feet thick on
the level of the ground, supporting an adobe superstructure, the whole being
40 feet high. This wall was pierced by 12 lofty doorways, 14 feet high.
But midway there are sockets for the reception of beams, showing the
existence of a second story, as described by Garcilasso. Between the transverse
and outer walls there were two series of pillars, 12 on each side, built
like the transverse wall, with 8 feet of wrought stone, and completed to a
height of 22 feet with adobes. These pillars appear to have supported the
second floor, where, according to Garcilasso, there was a shrine containing
the statue of Uira-cocha. At right angles to the temple, Squier discovered
the remains of a series of supplemental edifices surrounding courts, and
built upon a terrace 260 yards long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The peculiarities of the temple of Cacha consist in the use of rows of
columns to support a second floor, and in the great height of the walls. In
these respects it is unique, and if similar edifices ever existed, they appear
to have been destroyed previous to the rise of the Inca empire. The Cacha
temple belongs neither to the cyclopean period of the Piruas nor to the
Inca style of architecture. Connected with the strange myth of the wandering
prophet of Viracocha, it stands by itself, as one of those unsolved
problems which await future investigation. The statue in the shrine on
the upper story is described by Cieza de Leon, who saw it.</p>

<p>Both the Titicaca and the Cacha myths have, in later times, been connected
and more or less amalgamated with the ancestral myth of the Incas.
Thus Garcilasso de la Vega makes Manco Ccapac come direct from Titicaca;
while Molina refers to him as one of the beings created there, who
went down through the earth and came up at Paccari-tampu. Salcamayhua
makes the being Tonapa, of the Cacha myth, arrive at Apu Tampu, or Paccari-tampu,
and leave a sacred sceptre there, called <i>tupac yauri</i>, for Manco
Ccapac. These are later interpolations, made with the object of connecting
the family myth of the Incas with more ancient traditions. The wise men
of the Inca system, through the care of Spanish writers of the time of the
conquest, have handed down these three traditions and the catalogue of
kings. The Titicaca myth tells us of the Deity worshipped by the builders
of Tiahuanacu, and the story of the creation. The Cacha myth has reference
to some great reformer of very ancient times. The Paccari-tampu
myth records the origin of the Inca dynasty. Although they are overlaid
with fables and miraculous occurrences, the main facts touching the original
home of Manco Ccapac and his march to Cuzco are probably historical.</p>

<p>The catalogue of kings given by Montesinos, allowing an average of twenty
years for each, would place the commencement of the Pirua dynasty in
about 470 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; in the days when the Greeks, under Cimon, were defeating
the Persians, and nearly a century after the death of Sakya Muni in
India. This early empire flourished for about 1,200 years, and the disruption
took place in 830 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, in the days of King Egbert. The disintegration
continued for 500 years, and the rise of the Incas under Manco was
probably coeval with the days of St. Louis and Henry III of England.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> By
that time the country had been broken up into separate tribes for 500
years, and the work of reunion, so splendidly achieved by the Incas, was
most arduous. At the same time, the ancient civilization of the Piruas was
partially inherited by the various peoples whose ancestors composed their
empire; so that the Inca civilization was a revival rather than a creation.</p>

<p>The various tribes and nations of the Andes, separated from each other
by uninhabited wildernesses and lofty mountain chains, were clearly of the
same origin, speaking dialects of the same language. Since the fall of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Piruas they had led an independent existence. Some had formed powerful
confederations, others were isolated in their valleys. But it was only
through much hard fighting and by consummate statesmanship that the
one small Inca lineage established, in a period of less than three centuries,
imperial dominion over the rest. It will be well, in this place, to take a
brief survey of the different nations which were to form the empire of the
Incas, and of their territories.</p>

<p>The central Andean region, which was the home of the imperial race of
Incas, extends from the water-parting between the sources of the Ucayali
and the basin of Lake Titicaca to the river Apurimac. It includes wild
mountain fastnesses, wide expanses of upland, grassy slopes, lofty valleys
such as that in which the city of Cuzco is built, and fertile ravines, with
the most lovely scenery. The inhabitants composed four tribes: that of the
Incas in the valley of the Vilcamayu, of the Quichuas in the secluded ravines
of the Apurimac tributaries, and those of the Canas and Cauchis in the
mountains bordering on the Titicaca basin. These people average a height
of 5 ft. 4 in., and are strongly built. The nose is invariably aquiline, the
mouth rather large; the eyes black or deep brown, bright, and generally
deep set, with long fine lashes. The hair is abundant and long, fine, and of
a deep black-brown. The men have no beards. The skin is very smooth
and soft, and of a light coppery-brown color, the neck thick, and the shoulders
broad, with great depth of chest. The legs are well formed, feet and
hands very small. The Incas have the build and physique of mountaineers.</p>

<p>To the south of this cradle of the Inca race extended the region of the
Collas<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> and allied tribes, including the whole basin of Lake Titicaca, which
is 12,000 feet above the level of the sea. The Collas dwelt in stone huts,
tended their flocks of llamas, and raised crops of ocas, quinoas, and potatoes.
They were divided into several tribes, and were engaged in constant
feuds, their arms being slings and <i>ayllos</i>, or bolas. The Collas are remarkable
for great length of body compared with the thigh and leg, and they
are the only people whose thighs are shorter than their legs. Their build
fits them for excellence in mountain climbing and pedestrianism, and for
the exercise of extraordinary endurance.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> The homes of the Collas were
around the seat of ancient civilization at Tiahuanacu.</p>

<p>A remarkable race, apart from the Incas and Collas, of darker complexion
and more savage habits, dwelt and still dwell among the vast beds of reeds
in the southwestern angle of Lake Titicaca. They are called Urus, and
are probably descendants of an aboriginal people who occupied the Titicaca
basin before the arrival of the Hatun-runas from the south. The Urus
spoke a distinct language, called <i>Puquina</i>, specimens of which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
preserved by Bishop Oré.<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> The ancestors of the Urus may have been the
cromlech builders, driven into the fastnesses of the lake when their country
was occupied by the more powerful invaders, who erected the imperishable
monuments at Tiahuanacu. These Urus are now lake-dwellers. Their
homes consist of large canoes, made of the tough reeds which cover the shallow
parts of the lake, and they live on fish, and on quinua and potatoes,
which they obtain by barter.</p>

<p>North of Cuzco there were several allied tribes, resembling the Incas in
physique and language, in a similar stage of civilization, and their rivals in
power. Beyond the Apurimac, and inhabiting the valleys of the Andes
thence to the Mantaro, was the important nation of the Chancas; and still
further north and west, in the valley of the Xauxa, was the Huanca nation.
Agricultural people and shepherds, forming <i>ayllus</i>, or tribes of the Chancas
and Huancas, occupied the ravines of the maritime cordillera, and extended
their settlements into several valleys of the seacoast, between the Rimac
and Nasca. These coast people of Inca race, known as Chinchas, held
their own against an entirely different nation, of distinct origin and language,
who occupied the northern coast valleys from the Rimac to Payta,
and also the great valley of Huarca (the modern Cañete), where they had
Chincha enemies both to the north and south of them. These people were
called <i>Yuncas</i> by their Inca conquerors. Their own name was Chimu, and
the language spoken by them was called <i>Mochica</i>. But this question relating
to the early inhabitants of the coast valleys of Peru, their origin and
civilization, is the most difficult in ancient Peruvian history, and will require
separate consideration.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></p>

was sent by their descendants to the Spanish king in 1603. This genealogical record contained the likenesses
of the successive Incas and their wives, and the original is said to have disappeared. Mr. Markham supposes
this roll to have been the original of the portraits given in Herrera (see cut on p. 267 of the present volume);
but they are not the same, if Marcoy’s cuts are trustworthy. A set of likenesses appeared in Ulloa’s <i>Relacion
Histórica</i> (Madrid, 1748), iv. 604; and these were the originals of the series copied in the <i>Gentleman’s Mag.</i>,

</div></div>

<p>North of the Huanca nation, along the basin of the Marañon, there were
tribes which were known to the Incas by their head-dresses. These were
the Conchucus, Huamachucus, and Huacrachucus.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> Still further north, in
the region of the equator, was the powerful nation of Quitus.</p>

<p>All these nations of the Peruvian Andes appear to have once formed part
of the mighty prehistoric empire of the Pirhuas, and to have retained much
of the civilization of their ancestors during the subsequent centuries of
separate existence and isolation. This probably accounts for the ease with
which the Incas established their system of religion and government
throughout their new empire, after the conquests were completed. The
subjugated nations spoke dialects of the same language, and inherited many
of the usages and ideas of their conquerors. For the same reason they were
pretty equally matched as foes, and the Incas secured the mastery only by
dint of desperate fighting and great political sagacity. But finally they did
establish their superiority, and founded a second great empire in Peru.</p>

<p>The history of the rise and progress of Inca power, as recorded by native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
historians in their <i>quipus</i>, and retailed to us by Spanish writers, is, on the
whole, coherent and intelligible.
Many blunders were inevitable in
conveying the information from the
mouths of natives to the Spanish inquirers,
who understood the language
imperfectly, and whose objects often
were to reach foregone conclusions.
But certain broad historical facts are
brought out by a comparison of the
different authorities, the succession
of the last ten sovereigns is determined
by a nearly complete consensus
of evidence, and we can now relate
the general features of the rise
of Inca ascendency in Peru with a
certain amount of confidence.</p>

<p>The Inca people were divided into small <i>ayllus</i>, or lineages, when Manco
Ccapac advanced down the
valley of the Vilcamayu, from
Paccari-tampu, and forced the
<i>ayllu</i> of Alcaviza and the <i>ayllu</i>
of Antasayac to submit to
his sway. He formed the nucleus
of his power at Cuzco,
the land of these conquered
<i>ayllus</i>, and from this point his
descendants slowly extended
their dominion. The chiefs of
the surrounding <i>ayllus</i>, called
<i>Sinchi</i> (literally, “strong”),
either submitted willingly to
the Incas, or were subjugated.
Sinchi Rocca, the son, and
Lloque Yupanqui, the grandson,
of Manco, filled up a
swamp on the site of the present cathedral of Cuzco, planned out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
city,<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> and their reigns were mainly occupied in consolidating the small
kingdom founded by their predecessor. Mayta Ccapac, the fourth Inca, was
also occupied in consolidating his power round Cuzco; but his son, Ccapac
Yupanqui, subdued the Quichuas to the westward, and extended his sway as
far as the pass of Vilcañota, overlooking the Collao, or basin of Lake Titicaca.
Inca Rocca, the next sovereign, made few conquests, devoting his
attention to the foundation of schools, the organization of festivals and administrative
government, and to the construction of public works. His son,
named Yahuar-huaccac, appears to have been unfortunate. One authority
says that he was surprised and killed, and all agree that his reign was disastrous.
For seven generations the power and the admirable internal polity
of the Incarial government had been gradually organized and consolidated
within a limited area. The succeeding
sovereigns were great
conquerors, and their empire was
rapidly extended to the vast area
which it had reached when the
Spaniards first appeared on the
scene.</p>

<p>The son of Yahuar-huaccac assumed

defeated them in detail,
and annexed the whole basin of Lake Titicaca to his dominions. He also
conquered the lovely valley of Yucay, on the lower course of the Vilcamayu,
whither he retired to end his days. The eldest son of Uira-cocha, named
Urco, was incompetent or unworthy, and was either obliged to abdicate<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> in

as powerful and as civilized as herself. The kingdom of the Chancas, commencing
on the banks of the Apurimac, extended far to the east and north,
including many of the richest valleys of the Andes. Their warlike king,
Uscavilca, had already subdued the Quichuas, who dwelt in the upper valleys
of the Apurimac tributaries to the southward, and was advancing on
Cuzco, when Yupanqui pushed aside the imbecile Urco, and seized the helm.
The fate of the Incas was hanging on a thread. The story is one of thrilling
interest as told in the pages of Betanzos, but all authorities dwell more
or less on this famous Chanca war. The decisive battle was fought outside
the Huaca-puncu, the sacred gate of Cuzco. The result was long doubtful.
Suddenly, as the shades of evening were closing over the Yahuar-pampa,&mdash;“the
field of blood,”&mdash;a fresh army fell upon the right flank of the Chanca
host, and the Incas won a great victory. So unexpected was this onslaught
that the very stones on the mountain sides were believed to have been
turned into men. It was the armed array of the insurgent Quichuas who
had come by forced marches to the help of their old masters. The memory
of this great struggle was fresh in men’s minds when the Spaniards
arrived, and as the new conquerors passed over the battlefield, on their way
to Cuzco, they saw the stuffed skins of the vanquished Chancas set up as
memorials by the roadside.</p>

<p>The subjugation of the Chancas, with their allies the Huancas, led to a
vast extension of the Inca empire, which now reached to the shores of the
Pacific; and the last years of Yupanqui were passed in the conquest of the
alien coast nation, ruled over by a sovereign known as the Chimu. Thus
the reign of the Inca Yupanqui marks a great epoch. He beat down all
rivals, and converted the Cuzco kingdom into a vast empire. He received
the name of Pachacutec, or “he who changes the world,” a name which,
according to Montesinos, had on eight previous occasions been conferred
upon sovereigns of the more ancient dynasties.</p>

<p>Tupac Inca Yupanqui, the son and successor of Pachacutec, completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the subjugation of the coast valleys, extended his conquests beyond Quito
on the north and to Chile as far as the river Maule in the south, besides
penetrating far into the eastern forests.</p>

<p>Huayna Ccapac, the son of Tupac Inca Yupanqui, completed and consolidated
the conquests of his father. He traversed the valleys of the coast,
penetrated to the southern limit of Chile, and fought a memorable battle
on the banks of the “lake of blood” (Yahuar-cocha), near the northern
frontier of Quito. After a long reign,<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> the last years of which were passed
in Quito, Huayna Ccapac died in November, 1525. His eldest legitimate
son, named Huascar, succeeded him at Cuzco. But Atahualpa, his father’s
favorite, was at Quito with the most experienced generals. Haughty messages
passed between the brothers, which were followed by war. Huascar’s
armies were defeated in detail, and eventually the generals of Atahualpa
took the legitimate Inca prisoner, entered Cuzco, and massacred the family
and adherents of Huascar.<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> The successful aspirant to the throne was on
his way to Cuzco, in the wake of his generals, when he encountered Pizarro
and the Spanish invaders at Caxamarca. This war of succession would not,
it is probable, have led to any revolutionary change in the general policy of
the empire. Atahualpa would have established his power and continued to
rule, just as his ancestor Pachacutec did, after the dethronement of his
brother Urco.<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a></p>

<p>The succession of the Incas from Manco Ccapac to Atahualpa was evidently
well known to the Amautas, or learned men of the empire, and was
recorded in their <i>quipus</i> with precision, together with less certain materials
respecting the more ancient dynasties. Many blunders were committed by
the Spanish inquirers in putting down the historical information received
from the Amautas, but on the whole there is general concurrence among
them.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> Practically the Spanish authorities agree, and it is clear that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
native annalists possessed a single record, while the apparent discrepancies

<p class="p1">The religion of the Incas consisted in the worship of the supreme being
of the earlier dynasties, the Illa Ticsi Uira-cocha of the Pirhuas. This simple
faith was overlaid by a vast mass of superstition, represented by the
cult of ancestors and the cult of natural objects. To this was superadded
the belief in the ideals or souls of all animated things, which ruled and
guided them, and to which men might pray for help. The exact nature of
this belief in ideals, as it presented itself to the people themselves, is not at
all clear. It prevailed among the uneducated. Probably it was the idea to
which dreams give rise,&mdash;the idea of a double nature, of a tangible and a
phantom being, the latter mysterious and powerful, and to be propitiated.
The belief in this double being was extended to all animated nature, for
even the crops had their spiritual doubles, which it was necessary to worship
and propitiate.</p>

<p>But the religion of the Incas and of learned men, or Amautas, was a worship
of the Supreme Cause of all things, the ancient God of the Titicaca
myth, combined with veneration for the sun<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> as the ancestor of the reigning
dynasty, for the other heavenly bodies, and for the <i>malqui</i>, or remains
of their forefathers. This feeling of veneration for the sun, closely connected
with the beneficent work of the venerated object as displayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the course of the seasons, led to the growth of an elaborate ritual and to
the celebration of periodical festivals.</p>

<p>The weight of evidence is decisively in the direction of a belief on the
part of the Incas that a Supreme Being existed, which the sun must obey,
as well as all other parts of the universe. This subordination of the sun to
the Creator of all things was inculcated by successive Incas. Molina says,
“They did not know the sun as their Creator, but as created by the Creator.”
Salcamayhua tells us how the Inca Mayta Ccapac taught that the sun
and moon were made for the service of men, and that the chief of the Collas,
addressing the Inca Uira-cocha, exclaimed, “Thou, O powerful lord of
Cuzco, dost worship the teacher of the universe, while I, the chief of the
Collas, worship the Sun.” The evidence on the subject of the religion of
the Incas, collected by the Viceroy Toledo, showed that they worshipped
the Creator of all things, though they also venerated the sun; and Montesinos
mentions an edict of the Inca Pachacutec, promulgated with the object
of enforcing the worship of the Supreme God above all other deities. The
speech of Tupac Inca Yupanqui, showing that the sun was not God, but
was obeying laws ordained by God, is recorded by Acosta, Blas Valera, and
Balboa, and was evidently deeply impressed on the minds of their Inca informers.
This Inca compared the sun to a tethered beast, which always
makes the same round; or to a dart, which goes where it is sent, and not
where it wishes. The prayers from the Inca ritual, given by Molina, are
addressed to the god Ticsi Uira-cocha; the Sun, Moon, and Thunder being
occasionally invoked in conjunction with the principal deity.</p>

<p>The worship of this creating God, the Dweller in Space, the Teacher and
Ruler of the Universe, was, then, the religion of the Incas which had been
inherited from their distant ancestry of the cyclopean age. Around this
primitive cult had grown up a supplemental worship of creatures created by
the Deity, such as the heavenly bodies, and of objects supposed to represent
the first ancestors of <i>ayllus</i>, or tribes, as well as of the prototypes of
things on whom man’s welfare depended, such as flocks and animals of the
chase, fruit and corn. It has been asserted that the Deity, the Uira-cocha
himself, did not generally receive worship, and that there was only one temple
in honor of God throughout the empire, at a place called Pachacamac,
on the coast. But this is clearly a mistake. The great temple at Cuzco,
with its gorgeous display of riches, was called the “Ccuri-cancha Pacha-yachachicpa
huasin,” which means “the place of gold, the abode of the
Teacher of the Universe.” An elliptical plate of gold was fixed on the wall
to represent the Deity, flanked on either side by metal representations of
his creatures, the Sun and Moon. The chief festival in the middle of the
year, called Ccapac Raymi, was instituted in honor of the supreme Creator,
and when, from time to time, his worship began to be neglected by the people,
who were apt to run after the numerous local deities, it was again and
again enforced by their more enlightened rulers. There were Ccuri-canchas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
for the service of God, at Vilca and in other centres of vice-regal rule, besides
the grand fane of Cuzco.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

<p>Although the first and principal invocations
were addressed to the Creator,
prayers were also offered up to
the Sun and Moon, to the Thunder,
and to ancestors who were called
upon to intercede with the Deity.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>
The latter worship formed a very distinctive
feature in the religious observances
of nearly all the Incarial
tribes. The <i>Paccarina</i>, or forefather
of the <i>ayllu</i>, or lineage, was often
some natural object converted into a
<i>huaca</i>, or deity. The <i>Paccarina</i> of
the Inca family was the Sun; with his
sister and spouse, the Moon. A vast
hierarchy was set apart to conduct
the ceremonies connected with their
worship, and hundreds of virgins,
called <i>Aclla-cuna</i>, were secluded and
devoted to duties relating to the observances
in the Sun temples. Worship
was also offered to the actual
bodies of the ancestors, called <i>malqui</i>,
which were preserved with the greatest care, in caves called <i>machay</i>. On
solemn festivals each <i>ayllu</i> assembled with its <i>malqui</i>. The bodies of the
Incas were all preserved, clothed as when alive, and surrounded by their
special furniture and utensils. Three of these Inca mummies, with two
mummies of queens, were discovered by Polo de Ondegardo, then corregidor
of Cuzco, in 1559, and were sent by him to Lima for interment. Those
who saw them<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> reported that they were so well preserved that they appeared
to be alive; that they were in a sitting posture; that the eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
made of gold, and that they were arrayed in the insignia of their rank.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> The
<i>Paccarina</i>, or founder of the family, and the <i>malquis</i>, or mummies of ancestors,
thus formed the objects of a distinct belief and religion, based undoubtedly
on the conviction that every human being has a spiritual as well
as a corporeal existence; that the former is immortal, and that it is represented
by the <i>malqui</i>. The appearance of the departed in dreams and
visions was not an unreasonable ground for this belief, which certainly was
the most deeply rooted of all the religious ideas of the Peruvian people.
The <i>paccarina</i>, or ancestral deities, were innumerable. There was one or
more that received worship in every <i>tribe</i>, and was represented by a rock,
or some other natural object. Many were believed to be oracles. Some,
such as <i>Catequilla</i>, or <i>Apu-catequilla</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> the oracle of the Conchucu tribe, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>

</div></div>

<p>Religious ceremonials were closely connected with the daily life of the
people, and especially with the course of the seasons and the succession of
months, as they affected the operations of agriculture. It was important to
fix the equinoxes and solstices, and astronomical knowledge was a part of
the priestly office. There were names for many of the stars; their motions
were watched as well as those of the sun and moon; and though a record of
the extent of the astronomical knowledge of the Incas has not been preserved,
it is certain that they watched the time of the solstices and equinoxes
with great care, and that they distinguished between the lunar and
solar years. Pillars were erected to determine the time of the solstices,
eight on the east and eight on the west side of Cuzco, in double rows, four
and four, two low between two higher ones, twenty feet apart. They were
called <i>Sucanca</i>, from <i>suca</i>, a ridge or furrow, the alternate light and shade
between the pillars appearing like furrows. A stone column in the centre
of a level platform, called <i>Inti-huatana</i>, was used to ascertain the time of the
equinoxes. A line was drawn across the platform from east to west, and
watch was kept to observe when the shadow of the pillar was on this line
from sunrise to sunset, and there was no shadow at noon. The principal
<i>Inti-huatana</i> was in the square before the great temple at Cuzco; but
there are several others in different parts of Peru. The most perfect of
these observatories is at Pissac, in the valley of Vilcamayu.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> There is
another at Ollantay-tampu, a fourth near Abancay, and a fifth at Sillustani
in the Collao.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the Incas used a zodiac with twelve signs,
corresponding with the months of their solar year. The gold plates which
they wore on their breasts were stamped with features representing the sun,
surrounded by a border of what are probably either zodiacal signs or signs
for the months. Whether the ecliptic, or <i>huatana</i>, was thus divided or not,
it is certain that the sun’s motion was observed with great care, and that
the calendar was thus fixed with some approach to accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> The year, or
<i>Huata</i>, was divided into twelve <i>Quilla</i>, or moon revolutions, and these were
made to correspond with the solar year by adding five days, which were
divided among the twelve months. A further correction was made every
fourth year. Solar observations were taken and recorded every month.</p>

<p>The year commenced on the 22d of June, with the winter solstice, and
there were four great festivals at the occurrence of the solstices and equinoxes.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The celebrations of the solar year and of the seasons, in their bearings
on agriculture, were identical with the chief religious observances. The
Raymi, or festival of the winter solstice, in the first month, when the granaries
were filled after harvest, was established in special honor of the Sun.
Sacrifices of llamas and lambs, and of the first-fruits of the earth, were
offered up to the images of the Supreme Being, of the Sun, and of Thunder,
which were placed in the open space in front of the great temple; as
well as to the <i>huaca</i>, or stone representing the brother of Manco Ccapac, on
the hill of Huanacauri. There was also a procession of the priests and people
as far as the pass of Vilcañota, leading into the basin of Lake Titicaca,
sacrifices being offered up at various spots on the road. The sacrifices were
accompanied by prayers, and concluded with songs, called <i>huayllina</i>, and
dancing. Then followed the ploughing month, when it is said that the Inca
himself opened the season by ploughing a furrow with a golden plough in
the field behind the Colcampata palace, on the height above Cuzco.</p>

<p>The question here arises whether human sacrifices were offered up, in the
Inca ritual. This has been stated by Molina, Cieza de Leon, Montesinos,
Balboa, Ondegardo, and Acosta, and indignantly denied by Garcilasso de la
Vega. Cieza de Leon admits that there were occasional human sacrifices,
but adds that their numbers and the frequency of such offerings have been
grossly exaggerated by the Spaniards. If the sacrifices had been offered
under the idea of atonement or expiation, it might well be expected that
human sacrifices would be included. Under such ideas, men offered up
what they valued most, just as Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his son,
as Jephthah dedicated his daughter as a burnt-offering to Jehovah, and as
the king of Moab sacrificed his eldest son to Chemosh.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> But, except in the
Situa, when the idea was to efface sins by washing, the sacrifices of the Incas
were offerings of thanksgiving, not of expiation or atonement. The mistake
of the five writers who supposed that the Incas offered human sacrifices
was due to their ignorance of the language.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> The perpetration of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sacrifice was opposed to the religious ideas of the ancient Peruvians, and
formed no part of their ceremonial worship. Their ritual was almost exclusively
devoted to thanksgiving and rejoicings over the beneficence of their
Deity. The notion of expiation formed no part of their creed, while the
destruction involved in such a system was opposed to their economic and
carefully regulated civil polity.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a></p>

<p>The second great festival, called Situa, was celebrated at the vernal equinox.
This was the commencement of the rainy season, when sickness prevailed,
and the object of the ceremony was to pray to the Creator to drive
diseases and evils from the land. In the centre of the great square of Cuzco
a body of four hundred warriors was assembled, fully armed for war. One
hundred faced towards the Chincha-suyu road, one hundred faced towards
Anti-suyu, one hundred towards Colla-suyu, and one hundred towards Cunti-suyu,&mdash;the
four great divisions of the empire. The Inca and the high-priest,
with their attendants, then came from the temple, and shouted, “Go
forth all evils!” On the instant the warriors ran at great speed towards
the four quarters, shouting the same sentence as they went, until they each
came to another party, which took up the cry, and the last parties reached
the banks of great rivers, the Apurimac or Vilcamayu, where they bathed
and washed their arms. The rivers were supposed to carry the evils away to
the ocean. As the warriors ran through the streets of Cuzco, all the people
came to their doors, shaking their clothes, and shouting, “Let the evils be
gone!” In the evening they all bathed; then they lighted great torches of
straw, called <i>pancurcu</i>, and, marching in procession out of the city, they
threw them into the rivers, believing that thus nocturnal evils were banished.
At night, each family partook of a supper consisting of pudding made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
coarsely ground maize, called <i>sancu</i>, which was also smeared over their
faces and the lintels of their doorways, then washed off and thrown into the
rivers with the cry, “May we be free from sickness, and may no maladies
enter our houses!” The <i>huacas</i> and <i>malquis</i> were also bathed at the feast
of Situa. In the following days all the malquis were paraded, and there
were sacrifices, with feasting and dancing. A stone fountain, plated with
gold, stood in the great square of Cuzco, and the Inca, on this and other
solemn festivals, poured <i>chicha</i> into it from a golden vase, which was conducted
by subterranean pipes to the temple.</p>

<p>The third great festival at the summer solstice, called <i>Huaracu</i>, was the
occasion on which the youths of the empire were admitted to a rank equivalent
to knighthood, after passing through a severe ordeal. The Inca and
his court were assembled in front of the temple. Thither the youths were
conducted by their relations, with heads closely shorn, and attired in shirts
of fine yellow wool edged with black, and white mantles fastened round
their necks by woollen cords with red tassels. They made their reverences
to the Inca, offered up prayers, and each presented a llama for sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>
Proceeding thence to the hill of Huanacauri, where the venerated <i>huaca</i> to
Ayar Uchu was erected, they there received <i>huaras</i>, or breeches made of
aloe fibres, from the priest. This completed their manly attire, and they
returned home to prepare for the ordeal. A few days afterwards they were
assembled in the great square, received a spear, called <i>yauri</i>, and <i>usutas</i> or
sandals, and were severely whipped to prove their endurance. The young
candidates were then sent forth to pass the night in a desert about a league
from Cuzco. Next day they had to run a race. At the farther end of the
course young girls were stationed, called <i>ñusta-calli-sapa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> with jars of chicha,
who cried, “Come quickly, youths, for we are waiting!” but the course
was a long one, and many fell before they reached the goal. They also had
to rival each other in assaults and feats of arms. Finally their ears were
bored, and they received ear-pieces of gold and other marks of distinction
from the Inca. The last ceremony was that of bathing in the fountain
called Calli-puquio. About eight hundred youths annually passed through
this ordeal, and became adult warriors, at Cuzco, and similar ceremonies
were performed in all the provinces of the empire.</p>

<p>In the month following on the summer solstice, there was a curious religious
ceremony known as the water sacrifice. The cinders and ashes of all
the numerous sacrifices throughout the year were preserved. Dams were
constructed across the rivers which flow through Cuzco, in order that the
water might rush down with great force when they were taken away.
Prayers and sacrifices were offered up, and then a little after sunset all the
ashes were thrown into the rivers and the dams were removed. Then the
burnt-sacrifices were hurried down with the stream, closely followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
crowds of people on either bank, with blazing torches, as far as the bridge
at Ollantay-tampu. There two bags of coca were offered up by being
hurled into the river, and thence the sacrifices were allowed to flow onwards
to the sea. This curious ceremony seems to have been intended not only
as a thank-offering to the Deity, but as an acknowledgment of his omnipresence.
As the offerings flowed with the stream, they knew not whither, yet
went to Him, so his pervading spirit was everywhere, alike in parts unknown
as in the visible world of the Incas.</p>

<p>A sacred fire was kept alive throughout the year by the virgins of the
sun, and the ceremony of its annual renewal at the autumnal equinox was
the fourth great festival, called <i>Mosoc-nina</i>, or the “new fire.” Fire was
produced by collecting the sun’s rays on a burnished metal mirror, and the
ceremony was the occasion of prayers and sacrifices. The year ended with
the rejoicing of the harvest months, accompanied by songs, dances, and
other festivities.</p>

<p>Besides the periodical festivals, there were also religious observances
which entered into the life of each family. Every household had one or
more <i>lares</i>, called <i>Conopa</i>, representing maize, fruit, a llama, or other object
on which its welfare depended. The belief in divination and soothsaying,
the practice of fasting followed by confession, and worship of the family
malqui, all gave employment to the priesthood.</p>

<p>The complicated religious ceremonies connected with the periodical festivals,
the daily worship, and the requirements of private families gave rise
to the growth of a very numerous caste of priests and diviners. The pope
of this hierarchy, the chief pontiff, was called <i>Uillac Umu</i>, words meaning
“The head which gives counsel,” he who repeats to the people the utterances
of the Deity. He was the most learned and virtuous of the priestly
caste, always a member of the reigning family, and next in rank to the Inca.
The <i>Villcas</i>, equivalent to the bishops of a Christian hierarchy, were the
chief priests in the provinces, and during the greatest extension of the empire
they numbered ten. The ordinary ministers of religion were divided
into sacrificers, worshippers and confessors, diviners, and recluses.<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
indeed inevitable that, with a complicated ritual and a gorgeous ceremonial
worship, a populous class of priests and their assistants, of numerous grades
and callings, should come into existence.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p class="p2">But the intellectual movement and vigor of the Incas were not confined
to the priesthood. The Amautas or learned men, the poets and reciters of
history, the musical and dramatic composers, the Quipu-camayoc, or recorders
and accountants, were not necessarily, nor indeed generally, of the
priestly caste. It is probable that the Amautas, or men of learning, formed
a separate caste devoted to the cultivation of literature and the extension
of the language. Our knowledge of their progress and of the character of
their traditions and poetic culture is very limited, owing to the destruction
of records and the loss of oral testimony. The language has been preserved,
and that will tell us much; but only a few literary compositions have been
saved from the wreck of the Inca empire. Quichua was the name given to
the general language of the Incas by Friar Domingo de San Tomas, the
first Spaniard who studied it grammatically, possibly owing to his having
acquired it from people belonging to the Quichua tribe. The name continued
to be used, and has been generally adopted.<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> Garcilasso de la Vega
speaks of a separate court language of the Incas, but the eleven words he
gives as belonging to it are ordinary Quichua words, and I concur with Hervas
and William von Humboldt in the conclusion that this court language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of Garcilasso had no real existence.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> It is not mentioned by any other

<p>It was the custom for the Yaravecs or Bards to recite the deeds of former
Incas on public occasions, and these rhythmical narratives were orally preserved
and handed down by the learned men. Cieza de Leon tells us that
“by this plan, from the mouths of one generation the succeeding one was
taught, and they could relate what took place five hundred years ago as if
only ten years had passed. This was the order that was taken to prevent
the great events of the empire from falling into oblivion.” These historical
recitations and songs must have formed the most important part of Inca
literature. One specimen of imaginative poetry has been preserved by Blas
Valero, in which the thunder, followed by rain, is likened to a brother breaking
his sister’s pitcher; just as in the Scandinavian mythology the legend
which is the original source of our nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill employs
the same imagery. Pastoral duties are embodied in some of the later Quichuan
dramatic literature, and numerous love songs and <i>yaravies</i>, or elegies,
have been handed down orally, or preserved in old manuscripts. The
dances were numerous and complicated, and the Incas had many musical
instruments.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Dramatic representations, both of a tragic and comic character,
were performed before the Inca court. The statement of Garcilasso
de la Vega to this effect is supported by the independent evidence of Cieza
de Leon and of Salcamayhua, and is placed beyond a doubt by the sentence
of the judge, Areche, in 1781, who prohibited the celebration of these dramas
by the Indians. Father Iteri also speaks of the “Quichua dramas
transmitted to this day (1790) by an unbroken tradition.” But only one
such drama has been handed down to our own time. It is entitled Ollantay,
and records an historical event of the time of Yupanqui Pachacutec.
In its present form, as regards division into scenes and stage directions, it
shows later Spanish manipulation. The question of its antiquity has been
much discussed; but the final result is that Quichua scholars believe most
of its dialogues and speeches and all the songs to be remnants of the Inca
period.</p>

<p>The system of record by the use of <i>quipus</i>, or knots, was primarily a
method of numeration and of keeping accounts. To cords of various colors
smaller lines were attached in the form of fringe, on which there were
knots in an almost infinite variety of combination. The <i>Quipu-camayoc</i>, or
accountant, could by this means keep records under numerous heads, and
preserve the accounts of the empire. The <i>quipus</i> represented a far better
system of keeping accounts than the exchequer tallies which were used in
England for the same purpose as late as the early part of the present century.
But the question of the extent to which historical events could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
recorded by this system of knots is a difficult one. We have the direct
assertions of Montesinos, Salcamayhua, the anonymous Jesuit, Blas Valera,
and others, that not only narratives, but songs, were preserved by means of
the <i>quipus</i>. Von Tschudi believed that by dint of the uninterrupted studies of
experts during several generations,
the power of expression
became developed more and
more, and that eventually the
art of the <i>Quipu-camayoc</i>
reached a high state of perfection.
It may reasonably be
assumed that with some help
from oral commentary, codes
of laws, historical events, and
even poems were preserved in
the <i>quipus</i>. It was through
this substitute for writing that
Montesinos and the anonymous
Jesuit received their lists
of ancient dynasties, and Blas
Valera distinctly says that the
poem he has preserved was
taken from <i>quipus</i>. Still it
must have been rather a system
of mnemonics than of complete
record. Molina tells us
that the events in the reigns of all the Incas, as well as early traditions,
were represented by paintings on boards, in a temple near Cuzco, called
<i>Poquen cancha</i>.</p>

<p>The diviners used certain incantations to cure the sick, but the healing
art among the Incas was really in the hands of learned men. Those <i>Amautas</i>
who devoted themselves to the study of medicine had, as Acosta bears
testimony, a knowledge of the properties of many plants. The febrifuge
virtues of the precious <i>quinquina</i> were, it is true, unknown, or only locally
known. But the <i>Amautas</i> used plants with tonic properties for curing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
fevers; and they were provided with these and other drugs by an itinerant
caste, called Calahuayas or Charisanis, who went into the forests to procure
them. The descendants of these itinerant doctors still wander over
South America, selling drugs.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> The discovery of a skull in a cemetery

<p>The sovereign was the centre
of all civilization and all knowledge.
All literary culture, all
the religious ceremonial which
had grown up with the extension
of the empire, had the Inca for
their centre, as well as all the
military operations and all laws
connected with civil administration.
Originally but the <i>Sinchi</i>,
or chief of a small <i>ayllu</i>, the
greatness of successive Incas
grew with the extension of their
power, until at last they were
looked upon almost as deities
by their subjects. The greatest
lords entered their presence in
a stooping position and with a small burden on their backs. The imperial
family rapidly increased. Each Inca left behind him numerous
younger sons, whose descendants formed an <i>ayllu</i>, so that the later sovereigns
were surrounded by a numerous following of their own kindred,
from among whom able public servants were selected. The sovereign was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the “<i>Sapallan Inca</i>,” the sole and sovereign lord, and with good reason he
was called <i>Huaccha-cuyac</i>, or friend of the poor.</p>

<p>Enormous wealth was sent to Cuzco as tribute from all parts of the empire,
for the service of the court and of the temples. The special insignia
of the sovereign were the <i>llautu</i>, or crimson fringe round the forehead, the
wing feathers (black and white) of the alcamari, an Andean vulture, on the
head, forming together the <i>suntu paucar</i> or sacred head-dress; the <i>huaman
champi</i>, or mace, and the <i>ccapac-yauri</i>, or sceptre. His dress consisted of
shirts of cotton, tunics of dyed cotton in patterns, with borders of small gold
and silver plates or feathers, and mantles of fine vicuña wool woven and
dyed. The Incas, as represented in the pictures at Cuzco,<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> painted soon

wore a large golden <i>topu</i>, or pin, with figures engraved on the head, which
secured her <i>lliclla</i>, or mantle. All the utensils of the palace were of gold;
and so exclusively was that precious metal used in the service of the court
and the temple that a garden outside the Ccuri-cancha was planted with
models of leaves, fruit, and stalks made of pure gold.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>Two styles are discernible in Inca architecture. The earliest is an imitation
of the cyclopean works of their ancestors on a smaller scale. The
walls were built with polygonal-shaped stones with rough surfaces, but the
stones were much reduced in size. Rows of doorways with slanting sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and monolithic lintels adorn the façades; while recesses for <i>huacas</i>, shaped
like the doorways, occur in the interior walls. Part of the palace called the
Collcampata, at the foot of the Cuzco fortress, the buildings which were
added to the cyclopean work at Ollantay tampu, the older portion of the
Ccuri-cancha temple at Cuzco, the palaces at Chinchero and Rimac-tampu,
are in this earlier style. The later style is seen mainly at Cuzco, where
the stones are laid in regular courses. No one has described this superb
masonry better than Squier.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> No cement or mortar of any kind was used,
the edifices depending entirely on the accuracy of their stone-fitting for their
stability. The palaces and temples were built round a court-yard, and a
hall of vast dimensions, large enough for ceremonies on an extensive scale,
was included in the plan of most of the edifices. These halls were 200 paces
long by 50 to 60 broad. The dimensions of the Ccuri-cancha temple were
296 feet by 52, and the southwest end was apsidal. Serpents are carved in
relief on some of the stones and lintels of the Cuzco palaces. Hence the palace
of Huayna Ccapac is called Amaru-cancha.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> At Hatun-colla, near Lake
Titicaca, there are two sandstone pillars, probably of Inca origin, which are
very richly carved. They are covered with figures of serpents, lizards, and
frogs, and with elaborate geometrical patterns. The height of the walls of
the Cuzco edifices was from 35
to 40 feet, and the roofs were
thatched. One specimen of the
admirable thatching of the Incas
is still preserved at Azangaro.</p>

<p>There are many ruins throughout
Peru both in the earlier and
later styles; some of them, such
as those at Vilcashuaman and
Huanuco el viejo, being of great
interest. The Inca palace on the
island in Lake Titicaca is a rectangular
two-storied edifice, with
numerous rooms having ceilings formed of flat overlapping stones, laid with
great regularity. With its esplanade, beautiful terraced gardens, baths,
and fountains, this Titicaca palace must have been intended for the enjoyment
of beautiful scenery in comparative seclusion, like the now destroyed
palace at Yucay, in the valley of the Vilcamayu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>An example of the improvement of architecture after Inca subjugation is
shown in the curious burial-places, or <i>chulpas</i>, of the Collao, in the basin of
Lake Titicaca. The earliest, as seen at Acora near the lake, closely resemble
the rude cromlechs of Brittany. Next, roughly built square towers
are met with, with vaults inside. Lastly, the <i>chulpas</i> at Sillustani are well-built
circular towers, about 40 feet high and 16 feet in diameter at the base,
widening as they rise. A cornice runs round each tower, about three
fourths of the distance from the base to the summit. The stones are admirably
cut and fitted in nearly even courses, like the walls at Cuzco. The
interior circular vaults, which contained the bodies, were arched with overlapping
stones, and a similar dome formed the roof of the towers.</p>

<p>The architectural excellence reached by the Incas, their advances in the
other arts and in literature, and the imperial magnificence of their court and
religious worship, imply the existence of an orderly and well-regulated administrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
system. An examination of their social polity will not disappoint
even high expectations. The Inca, though despotic in theory, was
bound by the complicated code of rules and customs which had gradually
developed itself during the reigns of his ancestors. In his own extensive
family, composed of Auqui<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> and Atauchi,<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> Palla<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> and Ñusta,<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> to the number

<p>The whole empire was called Ttahuantin-suyu, or the
four united provinces. Each great province was governed by an Inca viceroy,
whose title was <i>Ccapac</i>, or <i>Tucuyricoc</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> The latter word means “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
who sees all.” Garcilasso describes the office as merely that of an inspector,
whose duty it was to visit the province and report. Under the viceroy
were the native <i>Curacas</i>, who governed the <i>ayllus</i>, or lineages. Each <i>ayllu</i>
was divided into sections of ten families, under an officer called <i>Chunca</i> (10)
<i>camayu</i>. Ten of these came under a <i>Pachaca</i> (100) <i>camayu</i>. Ten <i>Pachacas</i>
formed a <i>Huaranca</i> (1,000) <i>camayu</i>, and the <i>Hunu</i> (10,000) <i>camayu</i> ruled
over ten <i>Huarancas</i>. The <i>Chunca</i> of ten families was the unit of government,
and each <i>Chunca</i> formed a complete community.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>The cultivable land belonged to the people in their <i>ayllus</i>, each <i>Chunca</i>

as a rule the produce was divided at harvest time. The flocks of llamas
were divided into <i>Ccapac-llama</i>, belonging to the state, and <i>Huaccha-llama</i>,
owned by the people. Thus the land belonged to the <i>ayllu</i>, or tribe, and
each <i>puric</i>, or able-bodied man, had a right to his share of the crop, provided
that he had been present at the sowing. All those who were absent must
have been employed in the service of the Inca or Huaca, and subsisted on
the government or priestly share. Shepherds and mechanics were also dependent
on those shares. Officers called <i>Runay-pachaca</i> annually revised
the allotments, made the census, prepared statistics for the <i>Quipu-camayoc</i>,
and sent reports to the <i>Tucuyricoc</i>. The <i>Llacta-camayoc</i>, or village overseer,
announced the turns for irrigation and the fields to be cultivated when the
shares were grown apart. These daily notices were usually given from a
tower or terrace. There were also judges or examiners, called <i>Taripasac</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>
who investigated serious offences and settled disputes. Punishments for
crimes were severe, and inexorably inflicted. It was also the duty of these
officers, when a particular <i>ayllu</i> suffered any calamity through wars or natural
causes, to allot contingents from surrounding <i>ayllus</i> to assist the neighbor
in distress. There were similar arrangements when the completion or
repair of any public work was urgent. The most cruel tax on the people
consisted in the selection of the <i>Aclla-cuna</i>, or chosen maidens for the service
of the Inca, and the church, or <i>Huaca</i>. This was done once a year by
an ecclesiastical dignitary called the <i>Apu-Panaca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> or, according to one
authority, the <i>Hatun-uilca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> who was deputy of the high-priest. Service
under the Inca in all other capacities was eagerly sought for.</p>

<p>The industry and skill of the Peruvian husbandmen can scarcely alone
account for the perfection to which they brought the science of agriculture.
The administrative system of the Incas must share the credit. Not a spot
of cultivable land was neglected. Towns and villages were built on rocky
ground. Even their dead were buried in waste places. Dry wastes were
irrigated, and terraces were constructed, sometimes a hundred deep, up the
sides of the mountains. The most beautiful example of this terrace cultivation
may still be seen in the “Andeneria,” or hanging gardens of the valley
of Vilcamayu, near Cuzco. There the terraces, commencing with broad
fields at the edge of the level ground, rise to a height of 1,500 feet, narrowing
as they rise, until the loftiest terraces against the perpendicular mountain
side are not more than two feet wide, just room for three or four rows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of maize. An irrigation canal, starting high up some narrow ravine at the
snow level, is carried along the mountain side and through the terraces,
flowing down from one to another.</p>

<p>Irrigation on a larger scale was employed not only on the desert coast,
but to water the pastures and arable lands in the mountains, where there is
rain for several months in the year. The channels were often of considerable
size and great length. Mr. Squier says that he has followed them for
days together, winding amidst the projections of hills, here sustained by
high masonry walls, there cut into the living rock, and in some places conducted
in tunnels through sharp spurs of an obstructing mountain. An
officer knew the space of time necessary for irrigating each <i>tupu</i>, and each
cultivator received a flow of water in accordance with the requirements of
his land. The manuring of crops was also carefully attended to.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></p>

<p>The result of all this intelligent labor was fully commensurate with the
thought and skill expended. The Incas produced the finest potato crops
the world has ever seen. The white maize of Cuzco has never been
approached in size or in yield. Coca, now so highly prized, is a product
peculiar to Inca agriculture, and its cultivation required extreme care, especially
in the picking and drying processes. Ajï, or Chile pepper, furnished
a new condiment to the Old World. Peruvian cotton is excelled only by
Sea Island and Egyptian in length of fibre, and for strength and length of
fibre combined is without an equal. Quinua, oca, aracacha, and several
fruits are also peculiar to Peruvian agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p>The vast flocks of llamas<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> and alpacas supplied meat for the people, dried
<i>charqui</i> for soldiers and travellers, and wool for weaving cloth of every degree
of fineness. The alpacas, whose unrivalled wool is now in such large
demand, may almost be said to have been the creation of the Inca shepherds.
They can only be reared by the bestowal on them of the most constant
and devoted care. The wild <i>huanacus</i> and <i>vicuñas</i> were also sources
of food and wool supply. No man was allowed to kill any wild animal in
Peru, but there were periodical hunts, called <i>chacu</i>, in the different provinces,
which were ordered by the Inca. On these occasions a wide area
was surrounded by thousands of people, who gradually closed in towards the
centre. They advanced, shouting and starting the game before them, and
closed in, forming in several ranks until a great bag was secured. The
females were released, with a few of the best and finest males. The rest
were then shorn and also released, a certain proportion being killed for the
sake of their flesh. The <i>huanacu</i> wool was divided among the people of the
district, while the silky fleeces of the <i>vicuña</i> were reserved for the Inca.
The <i>Quipu-camayoc</i> kept a careful record of the number caught, shorn, and
killed.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The means of communication in so mountainous a country were an important
department in the administration of the Incas. Excellent roads for
foot passengers radiated from Cuzco to the remotest portions of the empire.
The Inca roads were level and well paved, and continued for hundreds of
leagues. Rocks were broken up and levelled when it was necessary, ravines
were filled, and excavations were made in mountain sides. Velasco measured
the width of the Inca roads, and found them to be from six to seven
yards, sufficiently wide when only foot passengers used them. Gomara gives
them a breadth of twenty-five feet, and says that they were paved with
smooth stones. These measurements were confirmed by Humboldt as
regards the roads in the Andes. The road along the coast was forty feet
wide, according to Zarate. The Inca himself travelled in a litter, borne by
mountaineers from the districts of Soras and Lucanas. <i>Corpa-huasi</i>, or rest-houses,
were erected at intervals, and the government messengers, or <i>chasquis</i>,
ran with wonderful celerity from one of these stations to another, where
he delivered his message, or <i>quipu</i>, to the next runner. Thus news was
brought to the central government from all parts of The empire with extraordinary
rapidity, and the Inca ate fresh fish at Cuzco which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
caught in the Pacific, three hundred miles away, on the previous day. Store-houses,
with arms, clothing, and provisions for the soldiers, were also built
at intervals along the roads, so that an army could be concentrated at any
point without previous preparation.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the facilities for communication, which were so
admirably established by the Incas, was the system of moving colonies from
one part of the empire to another. The evils of minute subdivision were
thus avoided, political objects were often secured, and the comfort of the
people was increased by the exchange of products. The colonists were
called <i>mitimaes</i>. For example, the people of the Collao, round Lake Titicaca,
lived in a region where corn would not ripen, and if confined to the
products of their native land they must have subsisted solely on potatoes,
quinua, and llama flesh. But the Incas established colonies from their villages
in the coast valleys of Tacna and Moquegua, and in the forests to the
eastward. There was constant intercourse, and while the mother country
supplied <i>chuñus</i> or preserved potatoes, <i>charqui</i> or dried meat, and wool to
the colonists, there came back in return, corn and fruits and cotton cloth
from the coast, and the beloved coca from the forests.</p>

<p>Military colonies were also established on the frontiers, and the armies of
the Incas, in their marches and extensive travels, promoted the circulation
of knowledge, while this service also gave employment to the surplus agricultural
population. Soldiers were brought from all parts of the empire,
and each tribe or <i>ayllu</i> was distinguished by its arms, but more especially by
its head-dress. The Inca wore the crimson <i>llautu</i>, or fringe; the <i>Apu</i>, or
general, wore a yellow <i>llautu</i>. One tribe wore a puma’s head; the Cañaris
were adorned with the feathers of macaws, the Huacrachucus with the
horns of deer, the Pocras and Huamanchucus with a falcon’s wing feathers.
The arms of the Incas and Chancas consisted of a copper axe, called
<i>champi</i>; a lance pointed with bronze, called <i>chuqui</i>; and a pole with a
bronze or stone head in the shape of a six-pointed star, used as a club,
called <i>macana</i>. The Collas and Quichuas came with slings and <i>bolas</i>, the
<i>Antis</i> with bows and arrows. Defensive armor consisted of a <i>hualcanca</i> or
shield, the <i>umachucu</i> or head-dress, and sometimes a breastplate. The
perfect order prevailing in civil life was part of the same system which
enforced strict discipline in the army; and ultimately the Inca troops were
irresistible against any enemy that could bring an opposing force into the
field. Only when the Incas fought against each other, as in the last civil
war, could the result be long doubtful.</p>

<p>The artificers engaged in the numerous arts and on public works subsisted
on the government share of the produce. The artists who fashioned the
stones of the Sillustani towers or of the Cuzco temple with scientific accuracy
before they were fixed in their places, were wholly devoted to their
art. Food and clothing had to be provided for them, and for the miners,
weavers, and potters. Gold was obtained by the Incas in immense quantities
by washing the sands of the rivers which flowed through the forest-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
province of Caravaya. Silver was extracted from the ore by means
of blasting-furnaces called <i>huayra</i>; for, although quicksilver was known
and used as a coloring material, its properties for refining silver do not appear
to have been discovered. Copper was abundant in the Collao and in
Charcas, and tin was found in the hills on the east side of Lake Titicaca,
which enabled the Peruvians to use bronze very extensively.<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> Lead was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
also known to them. Skilful workers in metals fashioned the vases and
other utensils for the use of the Inca and of the temples, forged the arms of
the soldiers and the implements of husbandry, and stamped or chased the
ceremonial breastplates, <i>topus</i>, girdles, and chains. The bronze and copper
warlike instruments, which were star-shaped and used as clubs, fixed at
the ends of staves, were cast in moulds. One of these club-heads, now in
the Cambridge collection, has six rays, broad and flat, and terminating in
rounded points. Each ray represents a human head, the face on one surface
and the hair and back of the head on the other. This specimen was
undoubtedly cast in a mould. “It is,” says Professor Putnam, “a good illustration
of the knowledge which the ancient Peruvians had of the methods
of working metals and of the difficult art of casting copper.”<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p>

<p>Spinning, weaving, and dyeing were arts which were sources of employment
to a great number of people, owing to the quantity and variety of the
fabrics for which there was a demand. There were rich dresses interwoven
with gold or made of gold thread; fine
woollen mantles, or tunics, ornamented
with borders of small square gold and
silver plates; colored cotton cloths
worked in complicated patterns; and
fabrics of aloe fibre and sheeps’ sinews
for breeches. Coarser cloths of llama
wool were also made in vast quantities.
But the potters art was perhaps the
one which exercised the inventive faculties
of the Peruvian artist to the greatest
extent. The silver and gold utensils,
with the exception of a very few
cups and vases, have nearly all been
melted down. But specimens of pottery,
found buried with the dead in great
profusion, are abundant. They are to
be seen in every museum, and at Berlin
and Madrid the collections are very
large.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> Varied as are the forms to be
found in the pottery of the Incas, and elegant as are many of the designs,
it must be acknowledged that they are inferior in these respects to the
specimens of the plastic art of the Chimu and other people of the Peruvian
coast. The Incas, however, displayed a considerable play of fancy in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
designs. Many of the vases were moulded into forms to represent animals,
fruit, and corn, and were used
as <i>conopas</i>, or household
gods. Others took the shape
of human heads or feet, or
were made double or quadruple,
with a single neck
branching from below.
Some were for interment
with the <i>malquis</i>, others for
household use.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> Professor
Wilson, who carefully examined
several collections of
ancient Peruvian pottery,
formed a high opinion of
their merit. “Some of the
specimens,” he wrote, “are
purposely grotesque, and by
no means devoid of true
comic fancy; while, in the
greater number, the endless
variety of combinations
of animate and inanimate
forms, ingeniously rendered
subservient to the requirements
of utility, exhibit fertility
of thought in the designer,
and a lively perceptive
faculty in those for
whom he wrought.”<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<p>There is a great deal more
to learn respecting this marvellous
Inca civilization.
Recent publications have,
within the last few years,
thrown fresh and unexpected
light upon it. There may be more information still undiscovered or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
inedited. As yet we can understand the wonderful story only imperfectly,
and see it by doubtful lights. Respecting some questions, even of the first
importance, we are still able only to make guesses and weigh probabilities.
Yet, though there is much that is uncertain as regards historical and other
points, we have before us the clear general outlines of a very extraordinary
picture. In no other part of America had civilization attained to such a
height among indigenous races. In no other part of the world has the
administration of a purely socialistic government been attempted. The
Incas not only made the attempt, but succeeded.</p>

<h3 class="p2"><a name="c259" id="c259">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE student of Inca civilization will first seek
for information from those Spanish writers who
lived during or immediately after the Spanish
conquest. They were able to converse with natives
who actually flourished before the disruption
of the Inca empire, and who saw the working
of the Inca system before the destruction
and ruin had well commenced. He will next
turn to those laborious inquirers and commentators
who, although not living so near the time,
were able to collect traditions and other information
from natives who had carefully preserved
all that had been handed down by their fathers.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>
These two classes include the writers of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. The authors
who have occupied themselves with the Quichua
language and the literature of the Incas have
produced works a knowledge of which is essential
to an adequate study of the subject.<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> Lastly,
a consideration of the publications of modern
travellers and scholars, who throw light on the
writings of early chroniclers, or describe the present
appearance of ancient remains, will show
the existing position of a survey still far from
complete, and the interest and charm of which
invite further investigation and research.</p>

<p>Foremost in the first class of writers on Peru
is Pedro de Cieza de Leon. A general account
of his works will be found elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> and the
present notice will therefore be confined to an
estimate of the labors of this author, so far as
they relate to Inca history and civilization.
Cieza de Leon conceived the desire to write an
account of the strange things that were to be
seen in the New World, at an early period of his
service as a soldier. “Neither fatigue,” he tells
us, “nor the ruggedness of the country, nor the
mountains and rivers, nor intolerable hunger and
suffering, have ever been sufficient to obstruct
my two duties, namely, writing and following my
flag and my captain without fault.” He finished
the First Part of his chronicle in September,
1550, when he was thirty-two years of age. It is
mainly a geographical description of the country,
containing many pieces of information, such
as the account of the Inca roads and bridges,
which are of great value. But it is to the Second
Part that we owe much of our knowledge of Inca
civilization. From incidental notices we learn
how diligently young Cieza de Leon studied the
history and government of the Incas, after he
had written his picturesque description of the
country in his First Part. He often asked the
Indians what they knew of their condition before
the Incas became their lords. He inquired into
the traditions of the people from the chiefs of
the villages. In 1550 he went to Cuzco with the
express purpose of collecting information, and
conferred diligently with one of the surviving descendants
of the Inca Huayna Ccapac. Cieza
de Leon’s plan, for the second part of his work,
was first to review the system of government of
the Incas, and then to narrate the events of the
reign of each sovereign. He spared no pains to
obtain the best and most authentic information,
and his sympathy with the conquered people, and
generous appreciation of their many good and
noble qualities, give a special charm to his narrative.
He bears striking evidence to the historical
faculty possessed by the learned men at
the court of the Incas. After saying that on the
death of a sovereign the chroniclers related the
events of his reign to his successor, he adds:
“They could well do this, for there were among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
them some men with good memories, sound
judgments, and subtle genius, and full of reasoning
power, as we can bear witness who have heard
them even in these our days.” Cieza de Leon
is certainly one of the most important authorities
on Inca history and civilization, whether we consider
his peculiar advantages, his diligence and
ability, or his character as a conscientious historian.</p>

<p>Juan José de Betanzos, like Cieza de Leon,
was one of the soldiers of the conquest. He
married a daughter of Atahualpa, and became
a citizen at Cuzco, where he devoted his time
to the study of Quichua. He was appointed
official interpreter to the Audience and to successive
viceroys, and he wrote a <i>Doctrina</i> and
two vocabularies which are now lost. In 1558
he was appointed by the viceroy Marquis of
Cañete, to treat with the Inca Sayri Tupac,<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> who
had taken refuge in the fastness of Vilcabamba;
and by the Governor Lope Garcia de Castro,
to conduct a similar negotiation with Titu Cusi
Yupanqui, the brother of Sayri Tupac. He was
successful in both missions. He wrote his most
valuable work, the <i>Suma y Narracion de los
Incas</i>, which was finished in the year 1551, by
order of the Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza,
but its publication was prevented by the death
of the viceroy. It remained in manuscript, and
its existence was first made known by the Dominican
monk Gregorio Garcia in 1607, whose
own work will be referred to presently. Garcia
said that the history of Betanzos relating to the
origin, descent, succession, and wars of the Incas
was in his possession, and had been of great use
to him. Leon Pinelo and Antonio also gave
brief notices of the manuscript, but it is only
twice cited by Prescott. The great historian
probably obtained a copy of a manuscript in the
Escurial, through Obadiah Rich. This manuscript
is bound up with the second part of Cieza
de Leon. It is not, however, the whole work
which Garcia appears to have possessed, but
only the first eighteen chapters, and the last incomplete.
Such as it is, it was edited and
printed for the <i>Biblioteca Hispano-Ultramarina</i>,
by Don Márcos Jiménez de la Espada, in 1880.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a></p>

<p>The work of Betanzos differs from that of
Cieza de Leon, because while the latter displays
a diligence and discretion in collecting information
which give it great weight as an authority,
the former is imbued with the very spirit of the
natives. The narrative of the preparation of
young Yupanqui for the death-struggle with the
Chancas is life-like in its picturesque vigor.
Betanzos has portrayed native feeling and character
as no other Spaniard has, or probably
could have done. Married to an Inca princess,
and intimately conversant with the language,
this most scholarly of the conquerors is only
second to Cieza de Leon as an authority. The
date of his death is unknown.</p>

<p>Betanzos and Cieza de Leon, with Pedro Pizarro,
are the writers among the conquerors
whose works have been preserved. But these
three martial scholars by no means stand alone
among their comrades as authors. Several other
companions of Pizarro wrote narratives, which
unfortunately have been lost.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> It is indeed surprising
that the desire to record some account of
the native civilization they had discovered should
have been so prevalent among the conquerors.
The fact scarcely justifies the term “rude soldiery,”
which is so often applied to the discoverers
of Peru.</p>

<p>The works of the soldier conquerors are certainly
not less valuable than those of the lawyers
and priests who followed on their heels.
Yet these latter treat the subject from somewhat
different points of view, and thus furnish supplemental
information. The works of four lawyers
of the era of the conquest have been preserved,
and those of another are lost. Of these, the
writings of the Licentiate Polo de Ondegardo are
undoubtedly the most important. This learned
jurist accompanied the president, La Gasca, in
his campaign against Gonzalo Pizarro, having
arrived in Peru a few years previously, and he
subsequently occupied the post of corregidor at
Cuzco. Serving under the Viceroy Don Francisco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
de Toledo, he was constantly consulted by
that acute but narrow-minded statesman. His
duties thus led Polo de Ondegardo to make diligent
researches into the laws and administration
of the Incas, with a view to the adoption of all
that was applicable to the new régime. But his
knowledge of the language was limited, and it is
necessary to receive many of his statements with
caution. His two <i>Relaciones</i>, the first dedicated
to the Viceroy Marques de Cañete (1561), and
the second finished in 1570,<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> are in the form of
answers to questions on financial revenue and
other administrative points. They include information
respecting the social customs, religious
rites, and laws of the Incas. These <i>Relaciones</i>
are still in manuscript. Another report by Polo de
Ondegardo exists in the National Library at Madrid,<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a>
and has been translated into English for
the Hakluyt Society.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> In this treatise the learned
corregidor describes the principles on which the
Inca conquests were made, the division and tenures
of land, the system of tribute, the regulations
for preserving game and for forest conservancy,
and the administrative details. Here and
there he points out a way in which the legislation
of the Incas might be imitated and utilized
by their conquerors.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a></p>

<p>Agustin de Zarate, though a lawyer by profession,
had been employed for some years in the
financial department of the Spanish government
before he went out to Peru with the Viceroy
Blasco Nuñez to examine into the accounts of
the colony. On his return to Spain he was entrusted
with a similar mission in Flanders. His
<i>Provincìa del Peru</i> was first published at Antwerp
in 1555.<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> Unacquainted with the native
languages, and ignorant of the true significance
of much that he was told, Zarate was yet a
shrewd observer, and his evidence is valuable as
regards what came under his own immediate
observation. He gives one of the best descriptions
of the Inca roads.</p>

<p>The <i>Relacion</i> of Fernando de Santillan is a
work which may be classed with the reports of
Polo de Ondegardo, and its author had equal advantages
in collecting information. Going out
to Peru as one of the judges of the Audiencia in
1550,<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> Santillan was for a short time at the head
of the government, after the death of the Viceroy
Mendoza, and he took the field to suppress
the rebellion of Giron. He afterwards served in
Chile and at Quito, where he was commissioned
to establish the court of justice. Returning to
Spain, he took orders, and was appointed Bishop
of the La Plata, but died at Lima, on his way to
his distant see, in 1576. The <i>Relacion</i> of Santillan
remained in manuscript, in the library of the
Escurial, until it was edited by Don Márcos
Jiménez de la Espada in 1879. This report appears
to have been prepared in obedience to a
decree desiring the judges of Lima to examine
aged and learned Indians regarding the administrative
system of the Incas. The report of Santillan
is mainly devoted to a discussion of the
laws and customs relating to the collection of
tribute. He bears testimony to the excellence
of the Inca government, and to the wretched
condition to which the country had since been
reduced by Spanish misrule.</p>

<p>The work of the Licentiate Juan de Matienzo,
a contemporary of Ondegardo, entitled <i>Gobierno
de el Peru</i>, is still in manuscript. Like Santillan
and Ondegardo, Matienzo discusses the ancient
institutions with a view to the organization of
the best possible system under Spanish rule.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>Melchor Bravo de Saravia, another judge of
the Royal Audience at Lima, and a contemporary
of Santillan, is said to have written a work on
the antiquities of Peru; but it is either lost or
has not yet been placed within reach of the student.
It is referred to by Velasco. Cieza de
Leon mentions, at the end of his Second Part,
that his own work had been perused by the
learned judges Hernando de Santillan and Bravo
de Saravia.</p>

<p>While the lawyers turned their attention chiefly
to the civil administration of the conquered people,
the priests naturally studied the religious
beliefs and languages of the various tribes, and
collected their historical traditions. The best
and most accomplished of these sacerdotal authors
appears to have been Blas Valera, judging
from the fragments of his writings which have
escaped destruction. He was a native of Peru,
born at Chachapoyas in 1551, where his father,
Luis Valera,<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> one of the early conquerors, had
settled. Young Blas was received into the Company
of Jesus at Lima when only seventeen years
of age, and, as he was of Inca race on the mother’s
side, he soon became useful at the College in
Cuzco from his proficiency in the native languages.
He did missionary work in the surrounding
villages, and acquired a profound
knowledge of the history and institutions of the
Incas. Eventually he completed a work on the
subject in Latin, and was sent to Spain by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Jesuit superiors with a view to its publication.
Unfortunately the greater part of his manuscript
was burnt at the sack of Cadiz by the Earl of
Essex in 1596, and Blas Valera himself died
shortly afterwards. The fragments that were
rescued fell into the hands of Garcilasso de la
Vega, who translated them into Spanish, and
printed them in his <i>Commentaries</i>. It is to Blas
Valera that we owe the preservation of two specimens
of Inca poetry and an estimate of Inca
chronology. He has also recorded the traditional
sayings of several Inca sovereigns, and
among his fragments there are very interesting
chapters on the religion, the laws and ordinances,
and the language of the Incas, and on the vegetable
products and medicinal drugs of Peru.
These fragments are evidence that Blas Valera
was an elegant scholar, a keen observer, and
thoroughly master of his subject. They enhance
the feeling of regret at the irreparable loss that
we have sustained by the destruction of the rest
of his work.</p>

<p>Next to Blas Valera, the most important authority
on Inca civilization, among the Spanish
priests who were in Peru during the sixteenth
century, is undoubtedly Christoval de Molina.
He was chaplain to the hospital for natives at
Cuzco, and his work was written between 1570
and 1584, the period embraced by the episcopate
of Dr. Sebastian de Artaun, to whom it is dedicated.
Molina gives minute and detailed accounts
of the ceremonies performed at all the
religious festivals throughout the year, with the
prayers used by the priests on each occasion.
Out of the fourteen prayers preserved by Molina,
four are addressed to the Supreme Being, two to
the sun, the rest to these and other deities combined.
His mastery of the Quichua language,
his intimacy with the native chiefs and learned
men, and his long residence at Cuzco give Molina
a very high place as an authority on Inca
civilization. His work has remained in manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a>
but it has been translated into English
and printed for the Hakluyt Society.<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a></p>

<p>Molina, in his dedicatory address to Bishop
Artaun, mentions a previous narrative which he
had submitted, on the origin, history, and government
of the Incas. Fortunately this account
was preserved by Miguel Cavello Balboa, an author
who wrote at Quito between 1576 and 1586.
Balboa, a soldier who had taken orders late in
life, went out to America in 1566, and settled at
Quito, where he devoted himself to the preparation
and writing of a work which he entitled
<i>Miscellanea Austral</i>. It is in three parts; but
only the third, comprising about half the work,
relates to Peru. Balboa tells us that his authority
for the early Inca traditions and history was
the learned Christoval de Molina, and this gives
special value to Balboa’s work. Moreover, Balboa
is the only authority who gives any account
of the origin of the coast people, and he also
supplies a detailed narrative of the war between
Huascar and Atahualpa. The portion relating
to Peru was translated into French and published
by Ternaux Compans in 1840.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a></p>

<p>The Jesuits who arrived in Peru during the
latter part of the sixteenth century were devoted
to missionary labors, and gave an impetus to
the study of the native languages and history.
Among the most learned was José de Acosta,
who sailed for Peru in 1570. At the early age
of thirty-five, Acosta was chosen to be Provincial
of the Jesuits in Peru, and his duties required
him to travel over every part of the country.
His great learning, which is displayed in
his various theological works, qualified him for
the task of writing his <i>Natural and Moral History
of the Indies</i>, the value of which is increased
by the author’s personal acquaintance with the
countries and their inhabitants. Acosta went
home in the Spanish fleet of 1587, and his first
care, on his return to Spain, was to make arrangements
for the publication of his manuscripts.
The results of his South American researches
first saw the light at Salamanca, in Latin, in 1588
and 1589. The complete work in Spanish, <i>Historia
Natural y Moral de las Indias</i>, was published
at Seville in 1590. Its success was never
doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> In his latter years Acosta presided
over the Jesuits’ College at Salamanca, where
he died in his sixtieth year, on February 15,
1600.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> In spite of the learning and diligence of
Acosta and of the great popularity of his work,
it cannot be considered one of the most valuable
contributions towards a knowledge of Inca civilization.
The information it contains is often
inaccurate, the details are less complete than in
most of the other works written soon after the
conquest,<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> and a want of knowledge of the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is frequently made apparent. The best
chapters are those devoted to the animal and
vegetable products of Peru; and Feyjoo calls
Acosta the Pliny of the New World.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a></p>

<p>The Licentiate Fernando Montesinos, a native
of Osuna, was one of the most diligent of all
those who in early times made researches into
the history and traditions of the Incas. Montesinos
went out in the fleet which took the Viceroy
Count of Chinchon to Peru, arriving early
in the year 1629. Having landed at Payta,
Montesinos travelled southwards towards the
capital until he reached the city of Truxillo. At
that time Dr. Carlos Marcelino Corni was Bishop
of Truxillo.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> Hearing of the virtue and learning
of Montesinos, Dr. Corni begged that he might
be allowed to stop at Truxillo, and take charge
of the Jesuits’ College which the good bishop
had established there. Montesinos remained
at Truxillo until the death of Bishop Corni, in
October, 1629,<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> and then proceeded to Potosi,
where he gave his attention to improvements in
the methods of extracting silver. He wrote a
book on the subject, which was printed at Lima,
and also compiled a code of ordinances for mines
with a view to lessening disputes, which was
officially approved. Returning to the capital,
he lived for several years at Lima as chaplain of
one of the smaller churches, and devoted all his
energies to the preparation of a history of Peru.
Making Lima his headquarters, the indefatigable
student undertook excursions into all parts of
the country, wherever he heard of learned natives
to be consulted, of historical documents to
be copied, or of information to be found. He
travelled over 1,500 leagues, from Quito to Potosi.
In 1639 he was employed to write an
account of the famous Auto de Fé which was
celebrated at Lima in that year. His two great
historical works are entitled <i>Memorias Antiguas
Historiales del Peru</i>, and <i>Anales ó Memorias
Nuevas del Peru</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> From Lima Montesinos proceeded
to Quito as “Visitador General,” with
very full powers conferred by the bishop.</p>

<p>The work of Montesinos remained in manuscript
until it was translated into French by M.
Ternaux Compans in 1840, with the title <i>Mémoires
Historiques sur l’ancien Pérou</i>. In 1882
the Spanish text was very ably edited by Don
Márcos Jiménez de la Espada.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> Montesinos
gives the history of several dynasties which preceded
the rise of the Incas, enumerating upwards
of a hundred sovereigns. He professes to have
acquired a knowledge of the ancient records
through the interpretations of the <i>quipus</i>, communicated
to him by learned natives. It was
long supposed that the accounts of these earlier
sovereigns received no corroboration from any
other authority. This furnished legitimate
grounds for discrediting Montesinos. But a
narrative, as old or older than that of the licentiate,
has recently been brought to light, in which
at least two of the ancient sovereigns in the lists
of Montesinos are incidentally referred to. This
circumstance alters the aspect of the question,
and places the <i>Memorias Antiquas del Peru</i> in a
higher position as an authority; for it proves
that the very ancient traditions which Montesinos
professed to have received from the natives
had previously been communicated to one other
independent inquirer at least.</p>

<p>This independent inquirer is an author whose
valuable work has recently been edited by Don
Márcos Jiménez de la Espada.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> His narrative
is anonymous, but internal evidence establishes
the fact that he was a Jesuit, and probably one
of the first who arrived in Peru in 1568, although
he appears to have written his work many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
afterwards. The anonymous Jesuit supplies information
respecting works on Peruvian civilization
which are lost to us. He describes the temples,
the orders of the priesthood, the sacrifices
and religious ceremonies, explaining the origin
of the erroneous statement that human sacrifices
were offered up. He also gives the code of
criminal law and the customs which prevailed
in civil life, and concludes his work with a short
treatise on the conversion of the Indians.</p>

<p>The efforts of the viceroys and archbishops of
Lima during the early part of the seventeenth
century to extirpate idolatry, particularly in the
province of Lima, led to the preparation of reports
by the priests who were entrusted with the
duty of extirpation, which contain much curious
information. These were the Fathers Hernando
de Avendaño, Francisco de Avila, Luis de Teruel,
and Pablo José de Arriaga. Avendaño, in
addition to his sermons in Quichua, wrote an account
of the idolatries of the Indians,&mdash;<i>Relacion
de las Idolatrias de los Indios</i>,&mdash;which is still in
manuscript. Avila was employed in the province
of Huarochiri, and in 1608 he wrote a report
on the idols and superstitions of the people, including
some exceedingly curious religious legends.
He appears to have written down the
original evidence from the mouths of the Indians
in Quichua, intending to translate it into Spanish.
But he seems to have completed only six
chapters in Spanish; or perhaps the translation
is by another hand. There are still thirty-one
chapters in Quichua awaiting the labors of some
learned Peruvian scholar. Rising Quichua students,
of whom there are not a few in Peru, could
undertake no more useful work. This important
report of Avila is comprised in a manuscript
volume in the National Library at Madrid, and
the six Spanish chapters have been translated
and printed for the Hakluyt Society.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Teruel
was the friend and companion of Avila. He
also wrote a treatise on native idolatries,<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> and
another against idolatry,<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> in which he discusses
the origin of the coast people. Arriaga wrote a
still more valuable work on the extirpation of
idolatry, which was printed at Lima in 1621, and
which relates the religious beliefs and practices
of the people in minute detail.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a></p>

<p>Antiquarian treasures of great value are buried
in the works of ecclesiastics, the principal
objects of which are the record of the deeds of
one or other of the religious fraternities. The
most important of these is the <i>Coronica Moralizada
del orden de San Augustin en el Peru;
del Padre Antonio de la Calancha</i> (1638-1653),<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>
which is a precious storehouse of details respecting
the manners and customs of the Indians and
the topography of the country. Calancha also
gives the most accurate Inca calendar. Of less
value is the chronicle of the Franciscans, by Diego
de Cordova y Salinas, published at Madrid
in 1643.</p>

<p>A work, the title of which gives even less
promise of containing profitable information, is
the history of the miraculous image of a virgin
at Copacabana, by Fray Alonso Ramos Gavilan.
Yet it throws unexpected light on the movements
of the <i>mitimaes</i>, or Inca colonists; it gives
fresh details respecting the consecrated virgins,
the sacrifices, and the deities worshipped in the
Collao, and supplies another version of the Inca
calendar.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p>The work on the origin of the Indians of the
New World, by Fray Gregorio Garcia,<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> who
travelled extensively in the Spanish colonies, is
valuable, and to Garcia we owe the first notice
of the priceless narrative of Betanzos. His separate
work on the Incas is lost to us.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> Friar
Martin de Múrua, a native of Guernica, in Biscay,
was an ecclesiastic of some eminence in
Peru. He wrote a general history of the Incas,
which was copied by Dr. Muñoz for his collection,
and Leon Pinelo says that the manuscript
was illustrated with colored drawings of insignia
and dresses, and portraits of the Incas.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a></p>

<p>The principal writers on Inca civilization in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the century immediately succeeding the conquest,
of the three different professions,&mdash;soldiers,
lawyers, and priests,&mdash;have now been passed
in review. Attention must next be given to
the native writers who followed in the wake
of Blas Valera. First among these is the Inca
Garcilasso de la Vega, an author whose name
is probably better known to the general reader
than that of any other who has written on the
same subject. Among the Spanish conquerors
who arrived in Peru in 1534 was Garcilasso
de la Vega, a cavalier of very noble
lineage,<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> who settled at Cuzco, and was married
to an Inca princess named Chimpa Ocllo,
niece of the Inca Huayna Ccapac. Their son,
the future historian, was born at Cuzco in
1539, and his earliest recollections were connected
with the stirring events of the civil
war between Gonzalo Pizarro and the president
La Gasca, in 1548. His mother died
soon afterwards, probably in 1550, and his
father married again. The boy was much in
the society of his mother’s kindred, and he
often heard them talk over the times of the
Incas, and repeat their historical traditions.
Nor was his education neglected; for the
good Canon Juan de Cuellar read Latin with
the half-caste sons of the citizens of Cuzco
for nearly two years, amidst all the turmoil
of the civil wars. As he grew up, he was employed
by his father to visit his estates, and he
travelled over most parts of Peru. The elder
Garcilasso de la Vega died in 1560, and the
young orphan resolved to seek his fortune in
the land of his fathers. On his arrival in Spain
he received patronage and kindness from his paternal
relatives, became a captain in the army
of Philip II, and when he retired, late in life, he
took up his abode in lodgings at Cordova, and
devoted himself to literary pursuits. His first
production was a translation from the Italian of
“The Dialogues of Love,” and in 1591 he completed
his narrative of the expedition of Hernando
de Soto to Florida.<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>As years rolled on, the Inca began to think
more and more of the land of his birth. The
memory of his boyish days, of the long evening
chats with his Inca relations, came back to him
in his old age. He was as proud of his maternal
descent from the mighty potentates of Peru as
of the old Castilian connection on his father’s
side. It would seem that the appearance of
several books on the subject of his native land
finally induced him to undertake a work in which,
while recording its own reminiscences and the
information he might collect, he could also comment
on the statements of other authors. Hence
the title of <i>Commentaries</i> which he gave to his
work. Besides the fragments of the writings of
Blas Valera, which enrich the pages of Garcilasso,
the Inca quotes from Acosta, from Gomara,
from Zarate, and from the First Part of
Cieza de Leon.<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> He was fortunate in getting
possession of the chapters of Blas Valera rescued
from the sack of Cadiz. He also wrote to all
his surviving schoolfellows for assistance, and
received many traditions and detailed replies on
other subjects from them. Thus Alcobasa forwarded
an account of the ruins at Tiahuanacu,
and another friend sent him the measurements
of the great fortress at Cuzco.</p>

<p>The Inca Garcilasso de la Vega is, without
doubt, the first authority on the civilization of
his ancestors; but it is necessary to consider his
qualifications and the exact value of his evidence.
He had lived in Peru until his twentieth year;
Quichua was his native language, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
constantly heard the traditions of the Incas related
and discussed by his mother’s relations.
But when he began to write he had been separated
from these associations for upwards of
thirty years. He received materials from Peru,
enabling him to compose a connected historical
narrative, which is not, however, very reliable.
The true value of his work is derived from his
own reminiscences, aroused by reading the books
which are the subjects of his Commentary, and
from his correspondence with friends in Peru.
His memory was excellent, as is often proved
when he corrects the mistakes of Acosta and
others with diffidence, and is invariably right.
He was not credulous, having regard to the age
in which he lived; nor was he inclined to give
the rein to his imagination. More than once we
find him rejecting the fanciful etymologies of the
authors whose works he criticises. His narratives
of the battles and conquests of the early
Incas often become tedious, and of this he is
himself aware. He therefore intersperses them
with more interesting chapters on the religious
ceremonies, the domestic habits and customs,
of the people, and on their advances in poetry,
astronomy, music, medicine, and the arts. He
often inserts an anecdote from the storehouse
of his memory, or some personal reminiscence
called forth by the subject on which he happens
to be writing. His statements frequently receive
undesigned corroboration from authors whose
works he never saw. Thus his curious account
of the water sacrifices, not mentioned by any
other published authority, is verified by the full
description of the same rite in the manuscript of
Molina. On the other hand, the long absence of
the Inca from his native country entailed upon
him grave disadvantages. His boyish recollections,
though deeply interesting, could not, from
the nature of the case, provide him with critical
knowledge. Hence the mistakes in his work are
serious and of frequent occurrence. Dr. Villar
has pointed out his total misconception of the
Supreme Being of the Peruvians, and of the significance
of the word “Uira-cocha.”<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> But, with
all its shortcomings,<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> the work of the Inca Garcilasso
de la Vega must ever be the main source
of our knowledge, and without his pious labors
the story of the Incas would lose more than half
its interest.</p>

<p>The first part of his <i>Commentarios Reales</i>,
which alone concerns the present subject, was
published at Lisbon in 1607.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> The author died
at Cordova at the age of seventy-six, and was
buried in the cathedral in 1616. He lived just
long enough to accomplish his most cherished
wish, and to complete the work at which he had
steadily and lovingly labored for so many years.</p>

<p>Another Indian author wrote an account of
the antiquities of Peru, at a time when the grandchildren
of those who witnessed the conquest
by the Spaniards were living. Unlike Garcilasso,
this author never left the land of his birth,
but he was not of Inca lineage. Don Juan de
Santacruz Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamayhua was
a native of the Collao, and descended from a
family of local chiefs. His work is entitled <i>Relacion
de Antigüedades deste Reyno del Peru</i>. It
long remained in manuscript in the National
Library at Madrid, until it was edited by Don
Márcos Jiménez de la Espada in 1879. It had
previously been translated into English and edited
for the Hakluyt Society.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> Salcamayhua
gives the traditions of Inca history as they were
handed down to the third generation after the
conquest. Intimately acquainted with the language,
and in a position to converse with the
oldest recipients of native lore, he is able to
record much that is untold elsewhere, and to
confirm a great deal that is related by former
authors. He has also preserved two prayers in
Quichua, attributed to Manco Ccapac, the first
Inca, and some others, which add to the number
given by Molina. He also corroborates the important
statement of Molina, that the great gold
plate in the temple at Cuzco was intended to
represent the Supreme Being, and not the sun.
Salcamayhua is certainly a valuable addition to
the authorities on Peruvian history.</p>

<p>While so many soldiers and priests and lawyers
did their best to preserve a knowledge of
Inca civilization, the Spanish government itself
was not idle. The kings of Spain and their official
advisers showed an anxiety to prevent the
destruction of monuments and to collect historical
and topographical information which is
worthy of all praise. In 1585, orders were given
to all the local authorities in Spanish America
to transmit such information, and a circular, containing
a series of interrogatories, was issued for
their guidance. The result of this measure was,
that a great number of <i>Relaciones descriptivas</i>
were received in Spain, and stored up in the archives
of the Indies. Herrera had these reports
before him when he was writing his history, but
it is certain that he did not make use of half the
material they contain.<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> Another very curious
and valuable source of information consists of
the reports on the origin of Inca sovereignty,
which were prepared by order of the Viceroy
Don Francisco de Toledo, and forwarded to the
council of the Indies. They consist of twenty
documents, forming a large volume, and preceded
by an introductory letter. The viceroy’s
object was to establish the fact that the Incas
had originally been usurpers, in forcibly acquiring
authority over the different provinces of the
empire, and dispossessing the native chiefs. His
inference was, that, as usurpers, they were rightfully
dethroned by the Spaniards. He failed to
see that such an argument was equally fatal to a
Spanish claim, based on anything but the sword.
Nevertheless, the traditions collected with this
object, not only from the Incas at Cuzco, but
also from the chiefs of several provinces, are
very important and interesting.<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a></p>

<p>The Viceroy Toledo also sent home four
cloths on which the pedigree of the Incas was
represented. The figures of the successive sovereigns
were depicted, with medallions of their
wives, and their respective lineages. The events
of each reign were recorded on the borders, the
traditions of Paccari-tampu, and of the creation
by Uira-cocha, occupying the first cloth. It is
probable that the Inca portraits given by Herrera
were copied from those on the cloths sent
home by the viceroy. The head-dresses in Herrera
are very like that of the high-priest in the
<i>Relacion</i> of the anonymous Jesuit. A map seems
to have accompanied the pedigree, which was
drawn under the superintendence of the distinguished
sailor and cosmographer, Don Pedro
Sarmiento de Gamboa.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<p>Much curious information respecting the laws
and customs of the Incas and the beliefs of the
people is to be found in ordinances and decrees
of the Spanish authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical.
These ordinances are contained in the
<i>Ordenanzas del Peru</i>, of the Licentiate Tomas
de Ballesteros, in the <i>Politica Indiana</i> of Juan
de Solorzano (Madrid, 1649),<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> in the <i>Concilium
Limense</i> of Acosta, and in the <i>Constituciones
Synodales</i> of Dr. Lobo Guerrero, Archbishop of
Lima, printed in that city in 1614, and again in
1754.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Quito received attention from
several early writers, but most of their manuscripts
are lost to us. Quito was fortunate, however,
in finding a later historian to devote himself
to the work of chronicling the story of his native
land. Juan de Velasco was a native of Riobamba.
He resided for forty years in the kingdom
of Quito as a Jesuit priest, he taught and
preached in the native language of the people,
and he diligently studied all the works on the
subject that were accessible to him. He spent
six years in travelling over the country, twenty
years in collecting books and manuscripts; and
when the Jesuits were banished he took refuge
in Italy, where he wrote his <i>Historia del Reino
de Quito</i>. Velasco used several authorities which
are now lost. One of these was the <i>Conquista
de la Provincia del Quito</i>, by Fray Marco de
Niza, a companion of Pizarro. Another was
the <i>Historia de las guerras civiles del Inca Atahualpa</i>,
by Jacinto Collahuaso. He also refers
to the <i>Antigüedades del Peru</i> by Bravo de Saravia.
As a native of Quito, Velasco is a strong
partisan of Atahualpa; and he is the only historian
who gives an account of the traditions respecting
the early kings of Quito. The work
was completed in 1789, brought from Europe,
and printed at Quito in 1844, and M. Ternaux
Compans brought out a French edition in 1840.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Recent authors have written introductory essays
on Peruvian civilization to precede the story
of the Spanish conquest, have described the
ruins in various parts of the country after personal
inspection, or have devoted their labors to
editing the early authorities, or to bringing previously
unknown manuscripts to light, and thus
widening and strengthening the foundation on
which future histories may be raised.</p>

<p>Robertson’s excellent view of the story of the
Incas in his <i>History of America</i><a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> was for many
years the sole source of information on the subject
for the general English public; but since
1848 it has been superseded by Prescott’s charming
narrative contained in the opening book of
his <i>Conquest of Peru</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> The knowledge of the
present generation on the subject of the Incas is
derived almost entirely from Prescott, and, so
far as it goes, there can be no better authority.
But much has come to light since his time.
Prescott’s narrative, occupying 159 pages, is
founded on the works of Garcilasso de la Vega,
who is the authority most frequently cited by
him, Cieza de Leon, Ondegardo, and Acosta.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>

<p>The publication of the <i>Antigüedades Peruanas</i>
by Don Mariano Eduardo de Rivero (the director
of the National Museum at Lima) and
Juan Diego de Tschudi at Vienna, in 1851,
marked an important turning-point in the progress
of investigation. One of the authors was
himself a Peruvian, and from that time some of
the best educated natives of the country have
given their attention to its early history. The
<i>Antigüedades</i> for the first time gives due prominence
to an estimate of the language and literature
of the Incas, and to descriptions of ruins
throughout Peru. The work is accompanied by
a large atlas of engravings; but it contains grave
inaccuracies, and the map of Pachacamac is a
serious blemish to the work.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> The <i>Antigüedades</i>
were followed by the <i>Annals of Cuzco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> and in
1860 the <i>Ancient History of Peru</i>, by Don Sebastian
Lorente, was published at Lima.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> In a series

gave the results of many years of further study
of the subject, which appear to have been the
concluding labors of a useful life. When he
died, in November, 1884, Sebastian Lorente had
been engaged for upwards of forty years in the
instruction of the Peruvian youth at Lima and
in other useful labors. A curious genealogical
work on the Incarial family was published at
Paris in 1850, by Dr. Justo Sahuaraura Inca, a
canon of the cathedral of Cuzco, but it is of no
historical value.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<p>Several scholars, both in Europe and America,
have published the results of their studies relating
to the problems of Inca history. Ernest
Desjardins has written on the state of Peru before
the Spanish conquest,<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> J. G. Müller on the

Peruvian anthropology.<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> The writings of Dr.
Brinton, of Philadelphia, also contain valuable
reflections and useful information respecting the
mythology and native literature of Peru.<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> Mr.
Bollaert had been interested in Peruvian researches
during the greater part of his lifetime
(b. 1807; d. 1876), and had visited several provinces
of Peru, especially Tarapaca. He accumulated
many notes. His work, at first sight,
appears to be merely a confused mass of jottings,
and certainly there is an absence of method and
arrangement; but closer examination will lead
to the discovery of many facts which are not to
be met with elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a></p>

<p>A critical study of early authorities and a
knowledge of the Quichua language are two essential
qualifications for a writer on Inca civilization.
But it is almost equally important that
he should have access to intelligent and accurate
descriptions of the remains of ancient edifices
and public works throughout Peru. For this he
is dependent on travellers, and it must be confessed
that no descriptions at all meeting the
requirements were in existence before the opening
of the present century. Humboldt was the
first traveller in South America who pursued his
antiquarian researches on a scientific basis. His
works are models for all future travellers. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>is to Humboldt,<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> and his predecessors the Ulloas,<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>
that we owe graphic descriptions of Inca
ruins in the kingdom of Quito and in northern
Peru as far as Caxamarca. French travellers
have contributed three works of importance to
the same department of research. M. Alcide
D’Orbigny examined and described the ruins of
Tiahuanacu with great care.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> M. François de
Castelnau was the leader of a scientific expedition
sent out by the French government, and his
work contains descriptions of ruins illustrated
by plates.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> The work of M. Wiener is more
complete, and is intended to be exhaustive. He
was also employed by the French government
on an archæological and ethnographic mission
to Peru, from 1875 to 1877, and he has performed
his task with diligence and ability, while
no cost seems to have been spared in the production
of his work.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> The maps and illustrations
are numerous and well executed, and M.
Wiener visited nearly every part of Peru where
archæological remains are to be met with. There
is only one fault to be found with the praiseworthy
and elaborate works of D’Orbigny and
Wiener. The authors are too apt to adopt theories
on insufficient grounds, and to confuse
their otherwise admirable descriptions with imaginative
speculations. An example of this kind
has been pointed out by the Peruvian scholar
Dr. Villar, with reference to M. Wiener’s erroneous
ideas respecting <i>Culte de l’eau ou de la
pluie, et le dieu Quonn</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> M. Wiener is the only
modern traveller who has visited and described
the interesting ruins of Vilcashuaman.</p>

<p>The present writer has published two books
recording his travels in Peru. In the first he
described the fortress of Hervay, the ancient
irrigation channels at Nasca on the Peruvian
coast, and the ruins at and around Cuzco, including
Ollantay-tampu.<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> In the second there
are descriptions of the <i>chulpas</i> at Sillustani in
the Collao, and of the Inca roof over the Sunturhuasi
at Azangaro.<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a></p>

<p>The work of E. G. Squier is, on the whole, the
most valuable result of antiquarian researches in
Peru that has ever been presented to the public.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Mr. Squier had special qualifications for
the task. He had already been engaged on
similar work in Nicaragua, and he was well
versed in the history of his subject. He visited
nearly all the ruins of importance in the country,
constructed plans, and took numerous photographs.
Avoiding theoretical disquisitions, he
gives most accurate descriptions of the architectural
remains, which are invaluable to the student.
His style is agreeable and interesting,
while it inspires confidence in the reader; and
his admirable book is in all respects thoroughly
workmanlike.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<p>Tiahuanacu is minutely described by D’Orbigny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Wiener, and Squier, and the famous ruins
have also been the objects of special attention
from other investigators. Mr. Helsby of Liverpool
took careful photographs of the monolithic
doorway in 1857, which were engraved and published,
with a descriptive article by Mr. Bollaert.<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>
Don Modesto Basadre has also written an account

the most complete monograph on Tiahuanacu
is by Mr. Inwards, who surveyed the ground,
photographed all the ruins, made enlarged drawings
of the sculptures on the monolithic doorway,
and even attempted an ideal restoration of
the palace. In the letter-press, Mr. Inwards
quotes from the only authorities who give any
account of Tiahuanacu, and on this particular
point his monograph entitles him to be considered
as the highest modern authority.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a></p>

<p>Another special investigation of equal interest,
and even greater completeness, is represented
by the superb work on the burial-ground of Ancon,
being the results of excavations made on
the spot by Wilhelm Reiss and Alphonso Stübel.
The researches of these painstaking and
talented antiquaries have thrown a flood of light
on the social habits and daily life of the civilized
people of the Peruvian coast.<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p>The great work of Don Antonio Raimondi on
Peru is still incomplete. The learned Italian
has already devoted thirty-eight years to the
study of the natural history of his adopted country,
and the results of his prolonged scientific
labors are now gradually being given to the public.
The plan of this exhaustive monograph is
a division into six parts, devoted to the geography,
geology, mineralogy, botany, zoölogy, and
ethnology of Peru. The geographical division
will contain a description of the principal ancient
monuments and their ruins, while the ethnology
will include a treatise on the ancient races, their
origin and civilization. But as yet only three
volumes have been published. The first is entitled
<i>Parte Preliminar</i>, describing the plan of
the work and the extent of the author’s travels
throughout the country. The second and third
volumes comprise a history of the progress of
geographical discovery in Peru since the conquest
by Pizarro. The completion of this great
work, undertaken under the auspices of the government
of Peru, has been long delayed.<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a></p>

<p>The labors of explorers are supplemented by
the editorial work of scholars, who bring to light
the precious relics of early authorities, hitherto
buried in scarcely accessible old volumes or in
manuscript. First in the ranks of these laborers
in the cause of knowledge, as regards ancient
Peruvian history, stands the name of M. Ternaux
Compans. He has furnished to the student
carefully edited French editions of the narrative
of Xeres, of the history of Peru by Balboa, of the
<i>Mémoires Historiques</i> of Montesinos, and of the
history of Quito by Velasco.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>The present writer has translated into English
and edited the works of Cieza de Leon, Garcilasso
de la Vega, Molina, Salcamayhua, Avila,
Xeres, Andagoya, and one of the reports of Ondegardo,
and has edited the old translation of
Acosta.</p>

<p>Dr. M. Gonzalez de la Rosa, an accomplished

<p>But in this department students are most indebted
to the learned Spanish editor, Don Márcos
Jiménez de la Espada; for he has placed
within our reach the works of important authorities,
which were previously not only inaccessible,
but unknown. He has edited the second
part of Cieza de Leon, the anonymous Jesuit,
Montesinos, Santillana, the reports to the Viceroy
Toledo, the <i>Suma y Narracion</i> of Betanzos,
and the <i>War of Quito</i>, by Cieza de Leon. Moreover,
there is every reason to hope that his
career of literary usefulness is by no means
ended.</p>

<p>Although so much has been accomplished in
the field of Peruvian research, yet much remains
to be done, both by explorers and in the study.
The Quichua chapters of the work of Avila,
containing curious myths and legends, remain
untranslated and in manuscript. A satisfactory
text of the Ollantay drama, after collation of all
accessible manuscripts, has not yet been secured.
Numerous precious manuscripts have
yet to be unearthed in Spain. Songs of the
times of the Incas exist in Peru, which should
be collected and edited. There are scientific
excavations to be undertaken, and secluded districts
to be explored. The Yunca grammar of
Carrera requires expert comparative study, and
comparison with the Eten dialect. Remnants of
archaic languages, such as the Puquina of the
Urus, must be investigated. When all this, and
much more, has been added to existing means
of knowledge, the labors of pioneers will approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
completion. Then the time will have
arrived for the preparation of a history of ancient
Peruvian civilization which will be worthy
of the subject.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b><a name="n275" id="n275">I.</a></b> <span class="smcap">Ancient People of the Peruvian Coast.</span>&mdash;There was a civilized people on the coast of Peru,
but not occupying the whole coast, which was distinctly different, both as regards race and language, from the
Incas and their cognate tribes. This coast nation was called <i>Chimu</i>, and their language <i>Mochica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a></p>

<p>The numerous valleys on the Peruvian coast, separated by sandy deserts of varying width, required only
careful irrigation to render them capable of sustaining a large population. The aboriginal inhabitants were
probably a diminutive race of fishermen. Driven southwards by invaders, they eventually sought refuge in
Arica and Tarapaca. D’Orbigny described their descendants as a gentle, hospitable race of fishermen, never
exceeding five feet in height, with flat noses, fishing in boats of inflated sealskins, and sleeping in huts of
sealskin on heaps of dried seaweed. They are called Changos. Bollaert mentions that they buried their
dead lengthways. Bodies found in this unusual posture near Cañete form a slight link connecting the Changos
to the south with the early aboriginal race of the more northern valleys.</p>

<p>The <i>Chimu</i> people drove out the aborigines and occupied the valleys of the coast from Payta nearly to
Lima, forming distinct communities, each under a chief more or less independent. The <i>Chimu</i> himself ruled
over the five valleys of Parmunca, Hualli, Huanapu, Santa, and Chimu, where the city of Truxillo now
stands. The total difference of their language from Quichua makes it clear that the Chimus did not come
from the Andes or from the Quito country. The only other alternative is that they arrived from the sea.
Balboa, indeed, gives a detailed account of the statements made by the coast Indians of Lambayeque, at the
time of the conquest. They declared that a great fleet arrived on the coast some generations earlier, commanded
by a chief named Noymlap, who had with him a green-stone idol, and that he founded a dynasty of
chiefs.</p>

<p>The <i>Chimu</i> and his subjects, let their origin be what it may, had certainly made considerable advances in
civilization. The vast palaces of the Chimu near the seashore, with a surrounding city, and great mounds or
artificial hills, are astonishing even in their decay. The principal hall of the palace was 100 feet long by 52.
The walls are covered with an intricate and very effective series of arabesques on stucco, worked in relief. A
neighboring hall, with walls stuccoed in color, is entered by passages and skirted by openings leading to small
rooms seven feet square, which may have been used as dormitories. A long corridor leads from the back of
the arabesque hall to some recesses where gold and silver vessels have been found. At a short distance from
this palace there is a sepulchral mound where many relics have been discovered. The bodies were wrapped in
cloths woven in ornamental figures and patterns of different colors. On some of the cloths plates of silver
were sewn, and they were edged with borders of feathers, the silver plates being occasionally cut in the shapes
of fishes and birds. Among the ruins of the city there are great rectangular areas enclosed by massive walls,
containing buildings, courts, streets, and reservoirs for water.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> The largest is about a mile south of the palace,
and is 550 yards long by 400. The outer wall is about 30 feet high and 10 feet thick at the base, with sides
inclining towards each other. Some of the interior walls are highly ornamented in stuccoed patterns; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
one part there is an edifice containing 45 chambers or cells, which is supposed to have been a prison. The
enclosure also contained a reservoir 450 feet long by 195, and 60 feet deep.</p>

<p>The dry climate favored the adornment of outer walls by color, and those of the Chimu palaces were covered
with very tasteful sculptured patterns. Figures of colored birds and animals are said to have been
painted on the walls of temples and palaces. Silver and gold ornaments and utensils, mantles richly embroidered,
robes of feathers, cotton cloths of fine texture, and vases of an infinite variety of curious designs, are
found in the tombs.</p>

<p>Cieza de Leon gives us a momentary glimpse at the life of the Chimu chiefs. Each ruler of a valley, he
tells us, had a great house with adobe pillars, and doorways hung with matting, built on extensive terraces.
He adds that the chiefs dressed in cotton shirts and long mantles, and were fond of drinking-bouts, dancing
and singing. The walls of their houses were painted with bright colored patterns and figures. Such places,
rising out of the groves of fruit-trees, with the Andes bounding the view in one direction and the ocean
in the other, must have been suitable abodes for joy and feasting. Around them were the fertile valleys,
peopled by industrious cultivators, and carefully irrigated. Their irrigation works were indeed stupendous.
“In the valley of Nepeña the reservoir is three fourths of a mile long by more than half a mile broad, and consists
of a massive dam of stone 80 feet thick at the base, carried across a gorge between two rocky hills. It
was supplied by two canals at different elevations; one starting fourteen miles up the valley, and the other
from springs five miles distant.”<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>The custom prevalent among the Chimus of depositing with their dead all objects of daily use, as well as
ornaments and garments worn by them during life,
has enabled us to gain a further insight into the
social history of this interesting people. The researches
of Reuss and Stübel at the necropolis of Ancon,
near Lima, have been most important. Numerous
garments, interwoven with work of a decorative
character, cloths of many colors and complicated
patterns, implements used in spinning and sewing,
work-baskets of plaited grass, balls of thread, fingerrings,
wooden and clay toys, are found with the mummies.
The spindles are richly carved and painted,
and attached to them are terra cotta cylinders aglow
with ornamental colorings which were used as wheels.
Fine earthenware vases of varied patterns, and
wooden or clay dishes, also occur.</p>

<p>Turning to the language of the coast people, we
find that no Mochica dictionary was ever made; but
there is a grammar and a short list of words by
Carrera, and the Lord’s prayer in Mochica, by Bishop
Oré. The grammar was composed by a priest who
had settled at Truxillo, near the ruins of the Chimu
palace, and who was a great-grandson of one of the
first Spanish conquerors. It was published at Lima
in 1644. At that time the Mochica language was
spoken in the valleys of Truxillo, Chicama, Chocope,
Sana, Lambayeque, Chiclayo, Huacabamba, Olmos,
and Motupè. When the <i>Mercurio Peruano</i><a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> was
published in 1793, this language is said to have entirely
disappeared. Father Carrera tells us that the
Mochica was so very difficult that he was the only
Spaniard who had ever been able to learn it. The
words bear no resemblance whatever to Quichua.
Mochica has three different declensions, Quichua
only one. Mochica has no transitive verbs, and no
exclusive and inclusive plurals, which are among the chief characteristics of Quichua. The Mochica conjugations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
are formed in quite a different way from those in the Quichua language. The Mochica system of
numerals appears to have been very complete. With the language, the people have now almost if not entirely
disappeared. Possibly the people of Eten, south of Lambayeque, who still speak a peculiar language, may
be descendants of the Chimus.</p>

<p>The Chimu dominion extended probably from Tumbez, in the extreme north of the Peruvian coast, to
Ancon, north of Lima. The Chimus also had a
strong colony in the valley of Huarcu, now called
Cañete. But the valleys of the Rimac, of Lurin,
Chilca, and Mala, north of Cañete; and those of
Chincha, Yca, and Nasca, south of Cañete; were
not Chimu territory. The names of places in those
valleys are all Quichua, as well as the names of
their chiefs, as recorded by Garcilasso de la Vega
and others. The inhabitants were, therefore, of
Inca race, probably colonists from the Huanca nation.
Their superstitions as told by Arriaga, and
the curious mythological legends recorded by
Avila as being believed by the people of Huarochiri
and the neighboring coast, all point to an Inca
origin. These Inca coast people are said to have
had a famous oracle near the present site of Lima,
called “Rimac,” or “He who speaks.” But more
probably it was merely the name given to the noisy
river Rimac, babbling over its stones. It is true
that there was a temple on the coast with an oracle,
the fame of which had been widely spread. The
idol called Pachacamac, or “The world-creator,”
was described by the first Spanish visitor, Miguel
Estete, as being made of wood and very dirty.
The town was then half in ruins, for the worship of
this local deity was neglected after the conquest by the Incas. These coast people of Inca race were as
industrious as their Chimu neighbors. In the Nasca valley there is a complete network of underground watercourses
for irrigation. At Yca “they removed the sand from vast areas, until they reached the requisite moisture,
then put in guano from the islands, and thus formed sunken gardens of extraordinary richness.”<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> Similar
methods were adopted in the valleys of Pisco and Chilca.</p>

<p>When the Inca Pachacutec began to annex the coast valleys, he met with slight opposition only from the
people of Inca origin, who soon submitted to his rule. But the Chimus struggled hard to retain their independence.
Those of the Huarcu (<i>Cañete</i>) valley made a desperate and prolonged resistance. When at
length they submitted, the Inca built a fortress and palace on a rocky eminence overlooking the sea to overawe
them. The ruins now called Hervai are particularly interesting, because they are the principal and
most imposing example of Inca architecture in which the building material is adobes and not stone. The
conquest of the valleys to the north of Lima and of the grand Chimu himself was a still more difficult undertaking,
necessitating more than one hard-fought campaign. When it was completed, great numbers of the
best fighting-men among the Chimus were deported to the interior as <i>mitimaes</i>. More than a century had
elapsed since this conquest when the Spaniards arrived, so that there was but slight chance of the history of the
Chimus being even partially preserved. Cieza de Leon and Balboa alone supply us with notices of any value.<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>
The southern valleys of the coast, Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna, were occupied by <i>mitimaes</i> or colonists
from the Collao. The Incas gave the general name of <i>yuncas</i>, or dwellers in the warm valleys, to all the
people of the coast.</p>

<p>Much mystery surrounds the history and origin of the <i>Chimu</i> people. That they were wholly separate and
unconnected with the other races of Peru seems almost certain. That they were far advanced in civilization
is clear. Difficulties surround any further prosecution of researches concerning them. They have themselves
disappeared from the face of the earth. Their language has gone with them. But there are the magnificent
ruins of their palaces and temples. There are numerous tombs and cemeteries which have never been scientifically
examined. There is a grammar and a small vocabulary of words calling for close comparative examination.
There are crania awaiting similar comparative study. There is a possibility that further information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
may be gleaned from inedited Spanish manuscripts. The subject is a most interesting one, and it is by no
means exhausted.</p>

<p><b><a name="n278" id="n278">II.</a></b> <span class="smcap">The Quichua Language and Literature</span>.&mdash;No real progress can be made in the work of elucidating
the ancient history of Peru, and in unravelling the interesting but still unsolved questions relating to
the origin and development of Inca civilization, without a knowledge of the native language. The subject
has accordingly received the close attention of laborious students from a very early period, and the present
essay would be incomplete without appending an enumeration of the Quichua grammars and vocabularies,
and of works relating to Inca literature.</p>

<p>Fray Domingo de San Tomas, a Dominican monk, was the first author who composed a grammar and
vocabulary of the language of the Incas. He gave it the name of Quichua, probably because he had studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
with members of that tribe, who were of pure Inca race, and whose territory lies to the westward of Cuzco.
The name has since been generally adopted for the language of the Peruvian empire.<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a></p>

<p>Diego de Torres Rubio was born in 1547, in a village near Toledo, became a Jesuit at the age of nineteen, and
went out to Peru in 1577. He studied the native languages with great diligence, and composed grammars and
vocabularies. His grammar and vocabulary of Quichua first appeared at Saville in 1603, and passed through
four editions.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> A long residence in Chuquisaca enabled him to acquire the Aymara language, and in 1616 he
published a short grammar and vocabulary of Aymara. In 1627 he also published a grammar of the Guarani
language. Torres Rubio was rector of the college at Potosi for a short time, but his principal labors were
connected with missionary work at Chuquisaca. He died in that city at the great age of ninety-one, on the
13th of April, 1638. Juan de Figueredo, whose Chinchaysuyu vocabulary is bound up with later editions of
Torres Rubio, was born at Huancavelica in 1648, of Spanish parents, and after a long and useful missionary
life he died at Lima in 1724.</p>

<p>The most voluminous grammatical work on the language of the Incas had for its author the Jesuit Diego
Gonzales Holguin. This learned missionary was the scion of a distinguished family in Estremadura, and
was befriended in his youth by his relation, Don Juan de Obando, President of the Council of the Indies.
After graduating at Alcalá de Henares he became a member of the Society of Jesus in 1568, and went out
to Peru in 1581. He resided for several years in the Jesuit college at Juli, near the banks of Lake Titicaca,
where the fathers had established a printing-press, and here he studied the Quichua language. He was entrusted
with important missions to Quito and Chili, and was nominated interpreter by the Viceroy Toledo.
His later years were passed in Paraguay, and when he died at the age of sixty-six, in 1618, he was rector of
the college at Asuncion. His Quichua dictionary was published at Lima in 1586, and a second edition appeared
in 1607,<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> the same year in which the grammar first saw the light.<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> The Quichua grammar of Holguin
is the most complete and elaborate that has been written, and his dictionary is also the best in every respect.</p>

<p>While Holguin was studiously preparing these valuable works on the Quichua language in the college at
Juli, a colleague was laboring with equal zeal and assiduity at the dialect spoken by the people of the Collao,
to which the Jesuits gave the name of Aymara. Ludovico Bertonio was an Italian, a native of the marches of
Ancona. Arriving in Peru in 1581, he resided at Juli for many years, studying the Aymara language, until,
attacked by gout, he was sent to Lima, where he died at the age of seventy-three, in 1625. His Aymara
grammar was first published at Rome in 1603,<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> but a very much improved second edition,<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> and a large dictionary
of Aymara,<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> were products of the Jesuit press at Juli in 1612. Bertonio also wrote a catechism and
a life of Christ in Aymara, which were printed at Juli.</p>

<p>A vocabulary of Quichua by Fray Juan Martinez was printed at Lima in 1604, and another in 1614. Four
Quichua grammars followed during the seventeenth century. That of Alonso de Huerta was published at
Lima in 1616; the grammar of the Franciscan Diego de Olmos appeared in 1633; Don Juan Roxo Mexia y
Ocon, a native of Cuzco, and professor of Quichua at the University of Lima, published his grammar in 1648;
and the grammar of Estevan Sancho de Melgar saw the light in 1691.<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> Leon Pinelo also mentions a Quichua
grammar by Juan de Vega. The anonymous Jesuit refers to a Quichua dictionary by Melchior Fernandez,
which is lost to us.</p>

<p>In 1644 Don Fernando de la Carrera, the Cura of Reque, near Chiclayo, published his grammar of the Yunca
language, at Lima. This is the language which was once spoken in the valleys of the Peruvian coast by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
civilized people whose ruler was the grand Chimu. Now the language is extinct, or spoken only by a few
Indians in the coast village of Eten. The work of Carrera is therefore important, as, with the exception of
a specimen of the language preserved by Bishop Oré, it is the only book in which the student can now obtain
any linguistic knowledge of the lost civilization. The Yunca grammar was reprinted in numbers in the
<i>Revista de Lima</i> of 1880 and following years.<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a></p>

<p>There was a professorial chair for the study of Quichua in the University of San Márcos at Lima, and the
language was cultivated, during the two centuries after the conquest, as well by educated natives as by many
Spanish ecclesiastics. The sermons of Dr. Don Fernando de Avendaño have already been referred to.<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>
Dr. Lunarejo, of Cuzco, was another famous Quichuan preacher, and the <i>Confesionarios</i> and catechisms in
the language were very numerous. Bishop Louis Geronimo Oré, of Guamanga, in his ritualistic manual, gives
the Lord’s prayer and commandments, not only in Quichua and Aymara, but also in the Puquina language
spoken by the Urus on Lake Titicaca, and in the Yunca language of the coast, which he calls Mochica.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>A very curious book was published at Lima in 1602, which, among other things, treats of the Quichua
language and of the derivations of names of places. The author, Don Diego D’Avalos y Figueroa, appears to
have been a native of La Paz. He was possessed of sprightly wit, was well read, and a close observer of
nature. We gather from his <i>Miscelanea Austral</i><a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> the names of birds and animals, and of fishes in Lake Titicaca,
as well as the opinions of the author on the cause of the absence of rain on the Peruvian coast, on the
lacustrine system of the Collao, and on other interesting points of physical geography.<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a></p>

<p>In modern times the language of the Incas has received attention from students of Peruvian history. The
joint authors, Dr. Von Tschudi and Don Mariano Eduardo de Rivero, in their work entitled <i>Antigüedades
Peruanas</i>, published at Vienna in 1851, devote a chapter to the Quichua language. Two years afterwards
Dr. Von Tschudi published a Quichua grammar and dictionary, with the text of the Inca drama of Ollantay,
and other specimens of the language.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> The present writer’s contributions towards a grammar and dictionary
of Quichua were published by Trübner in 1864, and a few years previously a more complete and elaborate
work had seen the light at Sucre, the capital of Bolivia. This was the grammar and dictionary by Father

<p>The curious publication of Don José Fernandez Nodal in 1874 is not so much a grammar of the Quichua
Language as a heterogeneous collection of notes on all sorts of subjects, and can scarcely take a place among
serious works. The author was a native of Arequipa, of good family, but he was carried away by enthusiasm
and allowed his imagination to run riot.<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a></p>

<p>The gospel of St. Luke, with Aymara and Spanish in parallel columns, was translated from the vulgate by

the purity of the language, and are therefore welcome to the student of Incarial history.</p>

<p>Quichua has been the subject of detailed comparative study by more than one modern philologist of eminence.
The discussion of the Quichua roots by the learned Dr. Vicente Fidel Lopez is a most valuable
addition to the literature of the subject; while the historical section of his work is a great aid to a critical consideration
of Montesinos and other early authorities. Whatever may be thought of his theoretical opinions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and of the considerations by which he maintains them, there can be no doubt that Dr. Lopez has rendered

<p>Editorial labors connected with the publication of the text and of translations of the Inca drama of Ollantay
have recently conduced, in an eminent degree, to the scholarly study
of Quichua, while they have sensibly contributed to a better knowledge
of the subject. Von Tschudi was the first to publish the text of
Ollantay, in the second part of his <i>Kechua Sprache</i>, having given
extracts from the drama in the chapter on the Quichua language in
the <i>Antigüedades Peruanas</i>. After a long interval he brought out
a revised text with a parallel German translation,<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> from his former
manuscript, collated with another bearing the date of La Paz, 1735.</p>

<p>The drama, in the exact form that it existed when represented before
the Incas, is of course lost to us. It was handed down by tradition
until it was arranged for representation, divided into scenes, and
supplied with stage directions in Spanish times. Several manuscripts
were preserved, which differ only slightly from each other; and they
were looked upon as very precious literary treasures by their owners.
The drama was first publicly brought to notice by Don Manuel Palacios,
in the <i>Museo Erudito</i>, a periodical published at Cuzco in 1837;
but it was not until 1853 that the text was printed by Von Tschudi.
His manuscript was copied from one preserved in the Dominican
monastery at Cuzco by one of the monks. The transcription was
made between 1840 and 1845 for the artist Rugendas, of Munich, who
gave it to Von Tschudi. There was another old manuscript in the
possession of Dr. Antonio Valdez, the priest of Sicuani, who lived in
the last century, and was a friend of the unfortunate Tupac Amaru.
Dr. Valdez died in 1816; and copies of his manuscript were possessed
by Dr. Pablo Justiniani, the aged priest of Laris, a village in the
heart of the eastern Andes, and by Dr. Rosas, the priest of Chinchero.
The present writer made a copy of the Justiniani manuscript at
Laris, which he collated with that of Dr. Rosas. In 1871 he published
the text of his copy, with an attempt at a literal English translation.<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a>
In 1868 Dr. Barranca published a Spanish translation from the text
of Von Tschudi, now called the Dominican text.<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> The Peruvian poet
Constantino Carrasco afterwards brought out a version of the drama
of Ollantay in verse, paraphrased from the translation of Barranca.<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a>
The enthusiastic Peruvian student, Dr. Nodal, printed a different
Quichua text with a Spanish translation, in parallel columns, in 1874.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a></p>

<p>There are other manuscripts, and a text has not yet been derived
from a scholarly collation of the whole of them. There is one in the
possession of Dr. Gonzalez de la Rosa, which belonged to Dr. Justo
Sahuaraura Inca, Archdeacon of Cuzco, and descendant of Paullu, the younger son of Huayna Ccapac. In
1878 the Quichua scholar and native of Cuzco, Don Gavino Pacheco Zegarra, published the text of Ollantay at
Paris, from a manuscript found among the books of his great-uncle, Don Pedro Zegarra. He added a very
free translation in French, and numerous valuable notes. The work of Zegarra is by far the most important
that has appeared on this subject, for the accomplished Peruvian has the great advantage of knowing Quichua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
from his earliest childhood. With this advantage, not possessed by any previous writer, he unites extensive
learning and considerable critical sagacity.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<p>The reasons for assigning an ancient date to this drama of Ollantay are conclusive in the judgment of all
Quichua scholars. On this point there is a consensus of opinion. But General Mitre, the ex-President of the
Argentine Republic, published an essay in 1881, to prove that Ollantay was of Spanish origin and was written
in comparatively modern times.<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> The present writer replied to his arguments in the introduction (p. xxix)
to the English translation of the second part of <i>Cieza de Leon</i> (1883), and this reply was translated into
Spanish and published at Buenos Ayres in the same year, by Don Adolfo F. Olivares, accompanied by a critical
note from the pen of Dr. Vicente Lopez.<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> The latest publication on the subject of Ollantay consists of a
series of articles in the <i>Ateneo de Lima</i>, by Don E. Larrabure y Unanue, the accomplished author of a
history of the conquest of Peru, not yet published. The general conclusion which has been arrived at by
Quichua scholars, after this thorough sifting of the question, is that, although the division into scenes and
the stage directions are due to some Spanish hand, and although some few Hispanicisms may have crept
into some of the texts, owing to the carelessness or ignorance of transcribers, yet that the drama of Ollantay, in
all essential points, is of Inca origin. Several old songs are imbedded in it, and others have been preserved
by Quichua scholars at Cuzco and Ayacucho, and in the neighborhood of those cities. The editing of these
remains of Inca literature will, at some future time, throw further light on the history of the past. There are
several learned Peruvians who devote themselves to Incarial studies, besides Señor Zegarra, who now resides
in Spain. Among them may be mentioned Dr. Villar of Cuzco, a ripe scholar, who has recently published
a closely reasoned essay on the word <i>Uira-cocha</i>, Don Luis Carranza, and Don Martin A. Mujica, a native of
Huancavelica.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE RED INDIAN OF NORTH AMERICA IN CONTACT
WITH THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH.</p>

<p class="pc">BY GEORGE E. ELLIS, D. D., LL. D.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>President of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE relations into which the first Europeans entered with the aborigines
in North America were very largely influenced, if not wholly
decided, by the relations which they found to exist among the tribes on
their arrival here. Those relations were fiercely hostile. The new-comers
in every instance and in every crisis found their opportunity and their
immunity in the feuds existing among tribes already in conflict with each
other. This state of things, while it gave the whites enemies, also furnished
them with allies. So far as the whites could learn in their earliest
inquiries, internecine strife had been waging here among the natives from
an indefinite past.</p>

<p>Starting, then, from this hostile relation between the native tribes of
the northerly parts of the continent, we may trace the development of our
subject through five periods:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The first period, a very brief one, is marked by the presence of a
single European nationality here, the French, for whom, under stringency
of circumstance that he might be in friendly alliance with one tribe, Champlain
was compelled to espouse its existing feud with other tribes.</p>

<p>2. The next period opens with the appearance and sharp rivalry here
of a second European nationality, the English, the hereditary foe of the
French, transferring hither their inherited animosities, amid which the
Indians were ground as between two mill-stones.</p>

<p>3. Upon the extinction of French dominion on the continent by the
English, the former red allies of the French, with secret prompting and
help from the dispossessed party, were stirred with fresh animosities against
the victors.</p>

<p>4. Yet again the open hostilities of contending Indian tribes were largely
turned to account, to their own harm, in their respective alliances with the
English colonies or with the mother-country in the War of Independence.</p>

<p>5. The closing period is that which is still in progress as covering the
relations with them of the United States government. The old hostilities
between those tribes have been steadily of less account in affecting their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
later fortunes; and our government has not found it essential or expedient
to aggravate its own severity against its Indian subjects, or “wards,” by
availing itself of the feuds between them.</p>

<p>The same antagonisms which had kept the Indian tribes in hostility with
each other prevented their effective alliance among themselves against the
whites, and also embarrassed the English and French rivals, who sought to
engage them on their respective sides. Many attempts were made by
master chiefs among the savages, from the first intrusion of the Europeans,
to organize combinations, or what we call “conspiracies,” of formerly contending
tribes against the common foe. The first of them, formidable
though limited in its consequences, was made in Virginia in 1622. Only
two of these schemes proved otherwise than wholly abortive. That of
King Philip in New England, in 1675, was effective enough to show what
havoc such a combination might work. That of Pontiac, in 1763, was vastly
more formidable, and was thwarted only by a resistance which engaged at
several widely severed points all the warlike resources of the English.
But the inherent difficulties, both of combining the Indian tribes among
themselves, and of engaging some of them in alliance on either side with
the French and the English contestants, were vastly increased by the seeds
of sharp dissension sown among them through the rivalries in trade and
temptations offered in the fluctuating prices of peltries. Even the long-standing
league of the Five Nations was ruptured by the resolute English
agent Johnson. He succeeded so far as to secure a promise of neutrality
from some of them, and a promise of friendly help from one of them.
There were some in each of the tribes falling not one whit behind the
sharpest of the whites in skilled sagacity and calculation, who were swift
to mark and to interpret the changes in the balance of fortune, as one or
the other of the parties of their common enemies made a successful stroke
for ascendency.</p>

<p>The facilities for alliance with one or another native tribe against its
enemies made for the Europeans a vast difference in the results of their
warfare with the aborigines. One might venture positively to assert that
the occupancy of this continent by Europeans would have been indefinitely
deferred and delayed had all its native tribes, in amity with each other, or
willing for the occasion to arrest their feuds, made a bold and united front
to resist the first intrusion upon their common domains. Certainly the
full truth of this assertion might be illustrated as applicable to many
incidents and crises in the first feeble and struggling fortunes of our
original colonists in various exposed and inhospitable places. In many
cases absolute starvation was averted only by the generous hospitality of
the Indians. Taking into view the circumstances under which, from the
first, tentative efforts were made for a permanent occupancy by the whites
on our whole coast from Nova Scotia to Florida, and along the lakes and
great western valleys, we must admit that their fortunes had more of peril
than of promise. While, of course, we must refer their success and security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in large measure to the forbearance, tolerance, and real kindliness of the
natives, yet it was well proved that as soon as the jealousy of these natives
was stirred at any threatened encroachment, only their own feuds disabled
them from any united opposition, and gave to one or another tribe the alternative
of fighting the white intruders or of an alliance with them against
their neighbor enemies. The whole series of the successive encroachments
of Europeans on this continent is a continuous illustration of the successful
turning to their own account of the strife of Indians against Indians.
And when two rival European nationalities opened their two centuries of
warfare for dominion on this continent, each party at once availed itself of
red allies ready to renew or prolong their own previous hostilities.</p>

<p>The French Huguenots in Florida and the Spaniards who massacred
them had each of them allies among the tribes which were in mutual hostility.
Champlain was grievously perplexed by the pressure, to which none
the less he yielded, that if he would be in amity with the Hurons he must
espouse their deadly enmity with the Iroquois. Even the poor remnants of
the tribe with which the Pilgrims of Plymouth made their treaty of peace,
which lasted for fifty years, were the vanquished and tributary representatives
of a broken people. A sharp war and a more deadly plague had made
that colony a possibility.</p>

<p>And so it comes to pass that, if we attempt to define at any period during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the conflicts between the savages
and Europeans on this continent, we have to look for the explanation
of any special change in the relations of the Indian tribes to the varying
interests and collisions of the different foreign nationalities in rivalry
here. The hostilities between the French and the English were chronic
and continuous. Frenchman’s Bay, at Mt. Desert, preserves the memorial
of the first collision, when Argall, from Virginia, broke up the attempted
settlement of Saussaye.<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> As to the later developments of the antagonism,
resulting in the extinction of French possession here, we are to refer them
in about equal measure to two main causes,&mdash;the jealousy of the home
governments, and the keen rivalry of the respective colonists for the lucrative
spoils of the fur trade. The profit of traffic may be regarded as
furnishing the prompting for strife on this side of the water, while the
passion for territorial conquest engaged the intrigues and the armies of
foreign courts in the stakes of wilderness warfare.</p>

<p>In tracing the course of such warfare we must take into our view two very
effective agencies, which introduced important modifications in the methods
and results of that warfare. In its progress these two agencies became
more and more chargeable with very serious consequences. The first of
these is the change induced in the warfare of the Indians by their possession
of, leading steadily to a dependence upon, the white man’s firearms and
supplies. The second is the usage, which the Indians soon learned to be
profitable, of reserving their white prisoners for ransom, instead of subjecting
them to death or torture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>When we read of some of the earliest so-called “deeds” by which the
English colonists obtained from the sachems wide spaces of territory on
the consideration of a few tools, hatchets, kettles, or yards of cloth, we
naturally regard the transaction as simply illustrating the white man’s
rapacity and cunning in tricking the simplicity of the savage. But we may
be sure that in many such cases the Indian secured what was to him a full
equivalent for that with which he parted. For, as the whites soon learned
by experience, the savages supposed that in such transactions they were
not alienating the absolute ownership of their lands, but only covenanting
for the right of joint occupancy with the English. And then the coveted
tools or implements obtained by them represented a value and a use not
measurable by any reach of wild territory. A metal kettle, a spear, a
knife, a hatchet, transformed the whole life of a savage. A blanket was to
him a whole wardrobe. When he came to be the possessor of firearms and
ammunition, having before regarded himself the equal of the white man,
he at once became his superior. We shall see how the rivalry between the
French and the English for traffic with the Indians, the enterprise of traders
in pushing into the wilderness with pack-horses, the establishment of trucking
houses, the facility with which the natives could obtain coveted goods
from either party, and the occasional failure of supplies in the contingencies
of warfare, were on many occasions the turning-points in the fights in
the wilderness, and in the shifting of savage partisanship from one side to
the other, as the fickle allies found their own interests at stake.</p>

<p>It was in 1609, when Champlain invaded the Iroquois country, on the
lake that bears his name, that the astounded savages first saw the flash and
marked the deadly effect of his arquebuse. But the shock soon spent itself.
The weapon was found to be a terrestrial one, made and put to service by
a man. The Dutch on the Hudson very soon supplied the Mohawks with
this effective instrument for prosecuting the fur trade. The French began
the general traffic with the Indians near the St. Lawrence, in metal vessels,
knives, hatchets, awls, cotton and woollen goods, blankets, and that most
coveted of all the white man’s stores, the maddening “fire-water.” But
farther north and west for full two hundred years, from 1670 quite down to
our own time, annual cargoes of these commodities were imported through
Hudson Bay by the chartered company, and had been distributed by its
agents among those who paid for them in peltries, in such abundance that
the savages became really dependent upon them, and gradually conformed
their habits to the use of them. Of course, in their raids upon English outposts,
the spoils of war in the shape of such supplies added rapacity to their
ferocity. It was with a proud flourish that Indian warriors, enriched by
the plunder on the field of Braddock’s disastrous defeat, strutted before the
walls of Fort Duquesne, arrayed in the laced hats, sashes, uniform, and
gorgets of British officers.</p>

<p>When Céloron was sent, in 1749, by the governor of Canada, to take possession
of interior posts along the Alleghanies, he found at each of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Indian villages, as at Logstown, a chief centre, from a single to a dozen
English traders, well supplied with goods for a brisk peltry traffic. He
required the chiefs, on the threat of the loss of his favor, to expel them and
to forbid their return. But the Indians insisted that they needed the goods.
Some of these traders were worthless reprobates, mostly Scotch-Irish, from
the frontiers of Pennsylvania. When Christopher Gist was sent, the next
year, by the Ohio Land Company, to follow Céloron and to thwart his
schemes, he complained strongly of these demoralized and demoralizing
traders. In the evidence given before the British House of Commons on
the several occasions when the monopoly and the mode of business of the
Hudson Bay Company were under question, the extent to which the natives
had come to depend upon European supplies was very strongly brought
into notice. It was urged that some of the tribes had actually, by disuse,
lost their skill in their old weapons. It was even affirmed that in some of
the tribes multitudes had died by freezing and starvation, because their
recent supplies had failed them. This dependence of the natives upon the
resources of civilization, observable from the opening of their intercourse
with the whites, has been steadily strengthening for two hundred years, till
now it has become an absolute and heavy exaction upon our national
treasury.</p>

<p class="p2">The custom which soon came in, to soften the atrocities of Indian warfare
by the holding of white prisoners for ransom, was grafted upon an earlier
usage among the natives of adopting prisoners or captives. There was a
formal ceremonial in such cases, and after its performance those who would
otherwise have been victims were treated with all kindness. The return
of a war-party to its own village was attended with widely different manifestations
according to the fortune which had befallen it. If it consisted
only of a baffled and flying remnant that had failed in its hazardous enterprise,
its coming was announced, and received by the old men, women, and
youths in the village with howls and lamentations. If, however, it had been
successful, as proved by rich plunder, reeking scalp-locks, and prisoners,
some runners were sent in advance to announce its approach. Then
began a series of orgies, in which the old squaws were the most demonstrative
and hideous. While the scalp-locks were displayed and counted, the
well-guarded prisoners were exultingly escorted by their captors, the squaws
gathering around them with taunts and petty tormentings. The woful
fate which was waiting these prisoners was foreshadowed in prolonged
rehearsals for its final horrors. One by one they were forced to run the
gauntlet from goal to goal, between lines of yelping fiends, under blows
and missiles, stones, sticks, and tomahawks, while efforts were made to trip
them in their course, that they might be pounded in their helplessness when
maddened with pain. Any exhibition of weakness or dread did but intensify
the malignant frenzy of their tormentors. Those who lived through
this ordeal, which was intended to be but a preliminary in the barbaric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
entertainment, and to stop short of the actual extinction of life, were
afterwards, by deliberate preparations made in full view of the prisoners,
subjected to all the ingenuities of rage and cruelty which untamed savage
fiendishness could devise. The hero who bore the trial without flinching,
singing his song of defiance, and in his turn mocking his tormentors
because they failed to break his spirit, was most likely to find mercy in a
finishing stroke dealt by a magnanimous foe.</p>

<p>Anything like an alleviation of these dread revenges of savage warfare
being unallowable, there was open one way of complete relief in the usage
of adoption, just referred to. This, however, was never available to the
prisoner from his own first motion or prompting. He was wholly passive
in the matter. It came solely from the inclination of any one in the village,
a warrior or a squaw who, having recently lost a relative, or one whose service
was necessary, might select a prisoner from the group as desirable to
supply a place that was vacant. There would seem to have been a large
liberty allowed in the exercise of this privilege, especially for those who
were mourning for a relative lost in the encounter in which the prisoner
was taken. Sometimes the merest caprice might prompt the selection.
Scarcely, except in the rare case of some proud captive who would haughtily
scorn to avail himself of a seeming affinity with the tribe of a hated or
abject enemy, would the offered privilege of adoption be refused. For, in
any case, an ultimate escape from an enforced durance might be looked
to. Of course those who were thus adopted were mostly the young and
vigorous. The little children were not especially favored in the process,&mdash;except,
as soon to be noted, the children of the whites. The ceremonial
for adoption was traditional. Beginning generally with somewhat rough
and intimidating treatment, the captive was for a while left in suspense as
to his fate. When at length the intent of the arbiter of his life was made
known to him, the method pursued has been very frequently described to
us in detail by the whites who were the subjects of it.<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> The candidate was
plunged and thoroughly soused in a stream to rinse out his white blood;
the hair of his head, saving the scalp-lock, was plucked out; and after some
mouthings and incantations, completing the initiation, all winning blandishments,
arts, and appliances were engaged to secure the confidence of the
adopted captive, and to draw from him some responsive sign of affection.
He was arrayed in the choicer articles of forest finery, and nestled in the
family lodge. The father, the squaw, or the patron, in whatever relation, to
whom he henceforward belonged, spared no effort to engage and comfort
him. Watchful eyes, of course, jealously guarded any restless motions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
looking towards an escape. The final aim was to secure a fully nationalized
and acclimated new member of a tribe, ready to share all its fortunes in
peace and war.</p>

<p>Naturally there were differences in this whole process and its results, as
they concerned these attempted affiliations between the members of Indian
tribes and in the adoption of white captives.<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a></p>

<p>In their early conflicts with the whites, the Indians generally practised an
indiscriminate slaughter. There were a few exceptions to the rule in King
Philip’s war.<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> In the raids of the French, with their Indian allies, upon the
English settlements, prisoners taken on either side came gradually to have
the same status as in civilized warfare, and to be held for exchange. This,
however, would proceed upon the supposition that both parties had prisoners.
But before there was anything like equality in this matter, the captives
were for the most part such as had been seized from among the whites
in inroads upon their settlements, not in the open field of warfare. A midnight
assault upon some frontier cabins, or upon the lodge of some lonely
settler, left the savages to choose between a complete massacre or upon
a selection of some of their victims for leading away with them to their
own haunts, if not too cumbersome or dangerous for the wilderness journey.
It soon came to be understood among the raiding parties of Indians in
alliance with the French in Canada that white captives had a ransom value.
Contributions were often gathered up in neighborhoods that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
raided, and in the meeting-houses of New England on Sundays, for redeeming
such captives as were known to be in Canada. And, curiously enough,
Judge Sewall in his journal records appeals for charity in the same form for
the redemption of captives in the hands of our own savages, and for the
ransom of our seamen and traders who were kept in durance by African
corsairs.</p>

<p>In the raids of desolation on either side of the Alleghanies and along
the sources of the Susquehannah and the Ohio, from the outbreak of the
French and Indian war, down to and even after the crushing of Pontiac’s
conspiracy, while more than a thousand cabins of the borderers were burned
and their inmates mostly slaughtered, several hundred captives were borne
off by the Indians and distributed among their villages. The ultimate fate
of these captives always hung in dread uncertainty. If a panic arose
among the lodges in apprehension of an onset from a war-party of the
whites, the captives might be massacred. But the force of circumstances
and the urgency of interested motives steadily made it an object for their
captors to retain their prisoners unharmed, and even to make captivity tolerable
to them. The alternative of death or life to them generally depended
upon whether they might escape or be released by an avenging party without
compensation, or could be held for redemption through a ransom. The
knowledge that the Indians retained such captives of course became a very
effective motive in inducing their relatives in the settlements to gather parties
of neighbors for following the victims into the forest depths. Temporary
truces also, when made by victorious parties of the whites, were conditioned
upon the surrender of all their surviving countrymen who were supposed to
be in duress. The savages practised all their artifices and subterfuges in
concealing some of their prisoners, alleging that they had been carried deeper
into the country by new masters, or by positively denying all knowledge of
their whereabouts. But the persistency and threats of those who had
learned how to deal with these red diplomates, with a few resolute strokes
generally brought about their surrender. When Bouquet had secured possession
of Fort Duquesne with his army of 1,500 men, he stoutly followed
up his success beyond the Ohio to the Indian settlements near the Muskingum,
and with his sturdy pluck and strong force he overawed the representatives
of the neighboring tribes which he had summoned to meet him.
He insisted, as the first condition of a truce, upon the delivery of all the
white prisoners secluded among them, not only without the payment of any
ransom, but upon their being brought in with a protecting escort and with
means of sustenance. Of course there was always ignorance or doubt as
to the number of captives in any particular place, and as to the hands into
which any individual known or supposed to be in durance might have fallen.
The word of an Indian on these points was worthless unless backed by
other testimony. A stimulating of the tongue into unguarded speech by a
dram of rum might in some cases serve the purpose of the rack or the
thumb-screw in more civilized cross-examinations. An uncertainty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
course always hung over the survival or the whereabouts of individuals or
members of a family whose bodies had not been found on the scene of an
Indian frontier raid. Bouquet was accompanied by friends and relatives of
supposed survivors held in captivity as the spoils of some massacre, and
these might be depended upon to circumvent the falsehoods and cunning of
the captors, and to insist upon their giving up their prizes. The persistency
and the plain evidence of resolved purpose manifested by Bouquet finally
compelled from the representatives of the tribes in council a pledge to surrender
all the prisoners in their hands, and messengers were sent out to
gather and bring them in, though with some plausible excuses for delay,
and the grudging return of only a part of them. But those who were
given up became the best witnesses as to the deception practised by the
cunning culprits in holding back others. Only after repeated exposures of
falsehood by those so grudgingly surrendered, asserting of their own knowledge
that there were others held in durance, whom they might even
know by name, was there brought about a full deliverance, saving that,
whether truly or falsely, in the case of a few individuals demanded the excuse
was alleged that they belonged to some chief or tribe absent at a distance
on a hunt, and so not to be reached by a summons. Bouquet was
also absolute in his demand for all such white captives, young or old, as
were alleged to have been adopted or married among the tribes. His firmly
insisting upon this, and the compliance with it in many cases, led to some
scenic manifestations in the wilderness, of a highly dramatic character, full
of the matter of romance in their revelations of the working of human
nature under novel and strange conditions. Such manifestations often
attended similar scenes in the ransom or forced surrender of whites who
had been in captivity among the Indians. But in this special instance of
Bouquet’s resolute course with the Ohio tribes, numbers, variety, picturesqueness
in those manifestations, gave to the bringing in and the reception
of captives features and incidents which strongly engage alike the
sympathies and antipathies of human nature. Some of those brought into
Bouquet’s camp, who had once at least been whites, came with full as much
reluctance on their part as that which was felt by those who gave them up.
Indeed, several of them could be secured only by being bound and guarded.</p>

<p>Approximation in all degrees to the manners and habits of Indian life
and to all the qualities of Indian nature had been realized by Europeans
from the first contact of the races on this continent. Of course the instances
were numerous and very decisive in which this approximation was
completed, and resulted in a substitution of all the ways and habits of savagery
for those of civilization. Many of those who were forced back into
Bouquet’s camp clung to their Indian friends, and repelled all the manifestations
of joy and affection of their own nearest kin by blood. They positively
refused to return to the settlements. They had been won by preference
to the fascinations and license of a life in the wilderness. This
preference was by no means inexplicable, even for some full-grown men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
women who had been reared in the white settlements. Life in scattered
cabins on the frontiers had more points of resemblance than of difference
in hard conditions and privations, when compared with savage life in the
woods. Such society as these scattered cabins afforded was rude and
rough, all experiences were precarious, daily drudgery was severe, the solitary
homes were gloomy, and only exceptional cases of early domestic and
mental training alleviated the stern exigencies of the condition of the first
generation of the settlers. For women and children especially, the outlook
and the routine of life were dismal enough. As for the men, the more
they conformed themselves in many respects to the actual habits and resources
of the Indians in the training of their instincts, in their garb,
their food, their adaptation of themselves to the ways and resources
of nature, the easier was their lot. Many women, likewise made captives
by the savages, in some cases of mature age, and having looked forward to
the usual lot of marriage, found an Indian to be preferable, or at all events
tolerable, as a husband. Children who preserved but a faint remembrance
of home and parents very readily adopted savage tastes, and testified by
their shrieks and struggles their unwillingness to part from their red friends.
Specimens from each of these classes were the most marked and demonstrative
among the groups brought in to Bouquet from Indian lodges, being
in number more than two hundred. Doubtless, however, the majority of
them had had enough of the experiences of savage life to make a return to
the settlements a welcome release. Such persons thenceforward constituted
a useful class as interpreters, mediators, and messengers between the
contending parties. Their knowledge of Indian character, superstitions,
limitations, weak and strong points, impulsive excitability, stratagems, and
adaptability to circumstance proved on many emergent occasions of good
account. Such of these returned captives as had had the rudiments of an
education, and were trustworthy as narrators, have made valuable contributions
to local history.</p>

<p>Among many such intelligent and trustworthy reporters was Col. James
Smith, captured on the borders of Pennsylvania in 1755, when eighteen
years of age, and kept in captivity five years. Another was John McCullough,
taken at about the same time and from the near neighborhood, when
eight years old. He was retained eight years, and, being a quick-witted and
observing youth, he kept his eyes and ears open to all that he could learn.
From such sources we derive the most authentic information we possess of
that transition period in the condition and fortunes of many of our aboriginal
tribes when the intrusion of Europeans upon them with their tempting
goods and their rival schemes, which equally tended to dispossess them of
their heritage, introduced among them so many novel complications. Some
of the narratives of the whites, who, under the conditions just referred to,
lived for years and were assimilated with the Indians, present us occasionally
by no means unattractive pictures of the ordinary tenor of life among
them. In the brief intervals of peace, and in some favored recesses where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
game abounded and the changing seasons brought round festivals, plays,
and scenes of jollity, there were even fascinations to delight one of simple
tastes, who could enjoy the aspects of nature, share the easy tramp over
mossy trails, content himself with the viands of the wilderness, employ
the long hours of laziness in easy handiwork, delight in basking beneath
the soft hazes of the Indian summer, or listening to the traditional lore of
the winter wigwam. The forests very soon began to be the shelter and the
roving haunts of a crew of renegades and outlaws from the settlements,
who assimilated at all points with the savages, and often used what remained
to them of the knowledge and arts of civilization for ingenious
purposes of mischief. It has always proved a vastly more easy and rapid
process for white men to fall back into barbarism than for an Indian to conform
himself to civilization. Wild life brought out all reversionary tendencies,
and revived primitive qualities and instincts. It gave those who shared
it a full opportunity to become oblivious of all fastidious tastes and of all
the squeamishness of over-delicacy. The promiscuous contents of the
camp-kettle, with its deposits and incrustations from previous banquets,
were partaken of with a zestful appetite. The circumstances of warfare in
the woods quickened all the faculties of watchfulness, made even the natural
coward brave, imparted endurance, and multiplied all the ingenuities of
resource and stratagem. There is something that surpasses the merely
marvellous in the feats of sturdy and persevering scouts, escaped captives,
remnants of a butchery, messengers sent to carry intelligence in supreme
peril, and lonely wayfarers treading the haunted forests, or creeping stealthily
through ambushed defiles, penetrating marshes, using the sky and their
woodcraft for guidance, fording or swimming choked or icy streams, climbing
high tree-tops for a wider survey from the closed woods and thickets,
subsisting on roots and berries and moss, and yielding to the exhaustion
of nature only when all perils were passed and the refuge was reached.
Alike on the march of armies and in the siege of some little forest stronghold
surrounded by yelping savages, it was necessary from time to time to
send out a single plucky hero to carry or to obtain intelligence. When
such a messenger was not designated by the commander, and the extremity
of the emergency left the dismal honor to a volunteer, such was never found
to be lacking. It confounds all calculations of the law of chances to learn
how, even in the majority of such dire enterprises as are on record, fortune
favored the brave. Narratives there are which for ages to come will
gather all the exciting elements of tragedy and romance, and occasionally
even of comedy, as, set down in the language of the woods, without the
constraints of art or grammar, they make us for the moment companions of
some imperilled man or woman who borrowed of the bear, the deer, the
fox, or the beaver, their several instincts and stratagems for outwitting
pursuit and clinging to dear life. Rare, it may be, but still well authenticated,
are cases of victims with a strong tenacity of vitality, who, left as
dead, mutilated and scalped, reasserted themselves when the foe had gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
found their way back to their homes, and, after such reconstruction as the
art of the time would allow, enjoyed a long life afterwards.</p>

<p>The conditions attending the entrance of European war-parties, with
their necessary supplies, into the depths of the wilderness were of the most
severe and exacting character. They involved equally the outlay of toil
and an exposure to perils requiring the most watchful vigilance. Well-worn
trails made by the natives, and always sufficiently travelled to keep
them open, had long been in use for such purposes as were needed in primitive
conditions. These were very narrow, necessitating that progress
should be made through them singly, in “Indian file.” At portages or carrying-places,
burdens were borne on the back from one watercourse to
another, round a rapid or across an elevation. Some of these trails are
even now traceable in the oldest settled portions of the country, where the
woods have never been wholly cleared. Part of that which was availed of
by the whites two hundred and fifty years ago between Plymouth and Boston,
and others in untilled portions of the Old Colony, are clearly discernible.
The thickets and undergrowths came close to the borders of these
trails, and the overhanging branches of the trees were found a grievous
annoyance when the earliest traders with pack-horses traversed them. In
a large part of our present national domain and in Canada, it may safely
be said that nineteen twentieths of all movement from place to place was
made by the savages by the watercourses of lake and stream, and the same
was done by the Europeans till they brought into use horses first, and then
carts. These were first put to service by the traders from the English settlements
on the frontiers of Pennsylvania and Virginia. The pack-horses,
heavily laden, trained to their rough service for rocky and marshy grounds,
as well as for the thick and stifling depths of the forest, and able to subsist
on very poor forage, carried goods most prized by the natives, and generally
in inverse ratio to their real worth. They returned to the settlements
from the Indian villages with a burden of precious furs, the traffickers
mutually finding their account in their respective shares in barter and profit.
These traders with their pack-horses were for a long time the pioneers of
the actual settlers. The methods and results of their traffic, trifling as they
may seem to be, had the two leading consequences of critical importance:
first, they made the Indians acquainted with and dependent upon the white
man’s goods, and then they provoked and embittered the rival competition
between the French and the English for the considerable profits.</p>

<p>What we now call a military road was first undertaken on a serious scale
in the advance of the disastrous expedition of General Braddock, in 1755,
over the Alleghanies to the forks of the Ohio. The incumbrances with
which he burdened himself might wisely have been greatly reduced in kind
and in amount. But the exigencies of the service in which he was engaged
were but poorly apprehended by him. As in the case of the even more
disastrous campaign of General Burgoyne, twenty-two years later, (1777)
though his route was mainly by water, the camp was lavishly supplied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
appliances of luxury and sensuality. Braddock’s way for his cattle, carts,
and artillery was slowly and poorly prepared by pioneers in advance, levelling
trees, stiffening marshy places, removing rocks and bushes, and then
leaving huge stumps in the devious track to rack the wagons and torment
the draught animals. It is not without surprise that we read of the presence
of domestic cattle far off in the extreme outposts of single persevering settlers.
But when, on the first extensive military expeditions for building a
fort on the shore of a lake, at river forks, or to command a portage, we find
mention of cannon and heavy ammunition, we marvel at the perseverance
involved in their transportation. The casks of liquor, of French brandy
and of New England rum, which generally, without stint, formed a part
of the stores of each military enterprise, furnished in themselves a motive
spirit which facilitated their transport. Flour and bread could, with
many risks from stream and weather, be carried in sacks. But pork and
beef in pickle, the mainstay in garrisons which could not venture out to
hunt or fish, required to be packed in wood. After all the persevering toil
engaged in this transportation, the dire necessities of warfare under these
stern conditions often compelled the destruction of the stores, every article
of which had tasked the strained muscles and sinews of the hard-worked
campaigners. When it was found necessary to evacuate a forest post, the
stockade was set on fire, the magazine was exploded, the cannon spiked,
the powder thrown into the water, and everything that could not be carried
off in a hasty retreat was, if possible, rendered useless as booty. As the
French and English military movements steadily extended over a wider
territory and at more numerous points, with increased forces, the waste and
havoc caused by disasters on either side involved an enormous destruction of
the materials of war. Vessels constructed with incredible labor on the lakes,
anvils, cordage, iron, and artillery having been gathered for their building
and arming by perilous ocean voyages and by transit through inner waters
and portages, and thousands of bateaux for Lakes Champlain and George,
now lie sunken in the depths, most of them destroyed by those in whose
service they were to be employed. The “Griffin,” the first vessel on Lake
Erie, built by La Salle in 1679, disappeared on her second voyage, and lies
beneath the waters still. After Braddock’s defeat, when the fugitive remnant
of his army had reached Dunbar’s camp, a hundred and fifty wagons
were burned, and fifty thousand pounds of powder were emptied into a
creek, after the incredible toil by which they had been drawn over the
mountains and morasses.</p>

<p>There were many occasions and many reasons which prompted the
Europeans to weigh the gain or loss which resulted to them from the employment
of Indian allies, who were always an incalculable element in any
enterprise. They could never be depended upon for constancy or persistency.
A bold stroke, followed, if successful, with butchery, and a rush to
the covert of the woods if a failure, was the sum of their strategy. They
had a quick eye in watching the turning fortunes and the probable issue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a venture, and they acted accordingly. They were wholly disinclined for
any protracted siege operations. In the weary months of the investment
of Detroit, the only enterprise of the sort engaged in by large bodies of
savages acting in concert, we find a single exceptional case of their uniform
impatience of such prolonged strategy. And even in that case there were
intervals when the imperilled and starving garrison had breathing-spells for
recuperation. Charges and counter-charges, pleas and criminations of every
kind, plausible, false, or sincere, are found in the journals and reports of
English and French officers, prompted by accusations and vindications of
either party, called out by the atrocities and butcheries wrought by their
savage allies in many of the conflicts of the French and Indian war. In
vain did the commanders of the white forces on either side promise that
their red allies should be restrained from plunder and barbarity against the
defeated party. It was an attempt to bridle a storm. From the written
opinions expressed by various civil and military officials during all our Indian
wars one might gather a list of judgments, always emphatically worded,
as to the qualities of the red men as allies. Governor Dinwiddie, writing
in May 28, 1756, to General Abercrombie, on his arrival here to hold the
chief command till the coming of Lord Loudon, expresses himself thus:
“I think we have secured the Six Nations to the Northward to our Interest
who, I suppose, will join your Forces. They are a very awkward, dirty sett
of People, yet absolutely necessary to attack the Enemy’s Indians in their
way of fighting and scowering the Woods before an Army. I am perswaded
they will appear a despicable sett of People to his Lordship and
you, but they will expect to be taken particular Notice of, and now and
then some few Presents. I fear General Braddock despised them too
much, which probably was of Disservice to him, and I really think without
some of them any engagement in the Woods would prove fatal, and if
strongly attached to our Interest they are able in their way to do more than
three Times their Number. They are naturally inclined to Drink. It will
be a prudent Stepp to restrain them with Moderation, and by some of your
Subalterns to shew them Respect.”<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> Baron Dieskau, in 1755, had abundant
reason for expressing himself about his savage auxiliaries in this fashion:
“They drive us crazy from morning to night. One needs the patience
of an angel to get on with these devils, and yet one must always force
himself to seem pleased with them.”<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It would seem as if the native tribes, when Europeans first secured a
lodgment, were beguiled by a fancy which in most cases was very rudely
dispelled. This fancy was that the new-comers might abide here without
displacing them. The natives in giving deeds of lands, as has been
said, had apparently no idea that they had made an absolute surrender of
territory. They seem to have imagined that something like a joint occupancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
was possible, each of the parties being at liberty to follow his own
ways and interests without molesting the other. So the Indians did not
move off to a distance, but frequented their old haunts, hoping to derive
advantage from the neighborhood of the white man. King Philip in 1675
discerned and acutely defined the utter impracticability of any such joint
occupancy. He indicated the root of the impending ruin to his own race,
and he found a justification of the conspiracy which he instigated in pointing
to the white man’s clearings and fences, and to the impossibility of
joining planting with hunting, and domestic cattle with wild game.</p>

<p>The history of the Hudson Bay Company and that of the enterprises conducted
by the French for more than a century, when set in contrast with
the steady development of colonization by English settlers and by the people
of the United States succeeding to them, brings out in full force the
different relations into which the aborigines have always been brought by
the presence of Europeans among them, either as traders or possessors of
territory. The Hudson Bay Company for exactly two centuries, from 1670
to 1870, held a charter for the monopoly of trade with the Indians here over
an immense extent of territory, and in the later portion of that period held
an especial grant for exclusive trade over an even more extended region,
further north and west. The company made only such a very limited occupancy
of the country, at small and widely distant posts, as was necessary
for its trucking purposes and the exchange of European goods for peltries.
During that whole period, allowing for rare casualties, not a single
act of hostility occurred between the traders and the natives. A large
number of different tribes, often at bitter feud with each other, were all
kept in amity with the official residents of the company, and each party
probably found as much satisfaction in the two sides of a bargain as is
usual in such transactions. Deposits of goods were securely gathered in
some post far off in the depths of the wilderness, under the care of two or
three young apprentices of the company, and here bands of Indians at the
proper season came for barter. Previous to the operations of this company,
beginning as early as 1620, large numbers of Frenchmen, singly or
in parties, ventured deep into the wilderness in company with savage
bands, for purposes of adventure or traffic, and very rarely did any of them
meet a mishap or fail to find a welcome. Such adventurers in fact became
in most cases Indians in their manner of life. Nor did the jealousy of
the savages manifest itself in a way not readily appeased when they found
the French priests planting mission stations and truck-houses. In no case
did the French intruders ask, as did the English colonists, for deeds of territory.
It was understood that they held simply by sufferance, and with a
view to mutual advantage for both parties, with no purpose of overreaching.
The relations thus established between the French and the natives
continued down till even after the extinction of the territorial claims of
France. And when, just before the opening of the great French and Indian
hostilities with the English colonists, the French had manifested their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
purpose to get a foothold on the heritage of the savages by pushing a line
of strongly fortified posts along their lakes and rivers, the apprehensions of
the savages were craftily relieved by the plea that these securities were
designed only to prevent the encroachment of the English.</p>

<p>A peaceful traffic with the Indians, like that of the Hudson Bay Company
and the French, had been from the first but a subordinate object of the English
colonists. These last, while for a period they confined themselves to the
seaboard, supplemented their agricultural enterprise by the fishery and by
a very profitable commerce. As soon as they began to penetrate into the
interior they took with them their families and herds, made fixed habitations,
put up their fences and dammed the streams. Instead of fraternizing
with the Indians, they warned them off as nuisances. We must also
take into view the fact that this steadily advancing settlement of the Indian
country directly provoked and encouraged the resolute though baffled
opposition of the savages. They could match forces with these scattered
pioneers, even if, as was generally the case, a few families united in constructing
a palisadoed and fortified stronghold to which they might gather
for refuge. If a body of courageous men had advanced together well prepared
for common defence, it is certain the warfare would not have been
so desultory as it proved to be. All the wiles of the Indians in conducting
their hostilities gave them a great advantage. They thought that the
whites might be dislodged effectually from further trespasses if once and
again they were visited by sharp penalties for their rash intrusion. It was
plain that they were long in coming to a full apprehension of the pluck of
their invaders, of their recuperative energies, and of the reserved forces
which were behind them. From the irregular base line of the coast the
English advanced into the interior, not by direct parallel lines, but rather
by successive semicircles of steadily extending radii. The advances from
the middle colonies of Pennsylvania and Virginia marked the farthest
reaches in this curvature. The French, in the mean while, aimed from the
start for occupying the interior.</p>

<p class="p2">The period which we have here under review is one through which the
savages, for the most part, were but subordinate agents, the principals being
the French and the English. So far as the diplomatic faculties of the
savages enabled them to hold in view the conditions of the strife, there were
doubtless occasions in which they thought they held what among civilized
nations is called the balance of power. Nor would it have been strange if,
at times, their chiefs had imagined that, though it might be impossible for
them again to hold possession of their old domains free from the intrusion
of the white man, they might have power to decide which of the two nationalities
should be favored above the other. In that case the French
doubtless would have been the favored party. We have, however, to take
into view the vast disproportion between the numbers, if not of the resources,
of these two foreign nationalities, when the struggle between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
earnestly began. In 1688 there were about eleven thousand of the French
in America, and nearly twenty times as many English. The French were
unified under the control of their home government. Its resources were
at their call: its army and navy, its arsenals and treasury, its monarch and
ministers, might be supposed to be serviceable and engaged for making its
mastery on this continent secure. The English, however, were only nominally,
and as regards some of the colonies even reluctantly and but truculently,
under the control of their home government. It had been the
jealous policy of the New England colonists, from their first planting, to
isolate themselves from the mother-country, and to make self-dependence
the basis of independence. Their circumstances had thrown them on their
own resources, and made them feel that as their foreign superiors could
know very little of their emergencies, it was not wise or even right in
them to interpose in their affairs. Indeed, it is evident that all the
British colonists felt themselves equal, without advice or help from abroad,
to take care of themselves, if they had to contend only against the savages.
But when the savages had behind them the power of the French monarch,
it was of necessity that the English should receive a reinforcement
from their own countrymen. In the altercations with the British
ministry which followed very soon after the close of the French and Indian
war, a keenly argued question came under debate as to the claim
which the mother-country had upon the gratitude of her colonists for coming
to their rescue when threatened with ruin from their red and white
enemies. And the answer to this question was judged to depend upon
whether, in sending hither her fleets and armies, Britain had in view an extension
of her transatlantic domains or the protection of her imperilled subjects.
At any rate, there were jealousies, cross-purposes, and an entire lack
of harmony between the direct representatives of English military power
and the coöperating measures of the colonial government. Never, under
any stress of circumstances, was England willing to raise even the most
serviceable of the officers of the provincial forces to the rank of regulars
in her own army. The youthful Washington, whose sagacity and prowess
had proved themselves in field and council where British officers were so
humiliated, had to remain content with the rank of a provincial colonel.
Nor did the provincial legislatures act in concert either with each other, or
with the advice and appeals of their royal governors in raising men, money
or supplies for combined military operations against common enemies.
Each of the colonies thought it sufficient to provide for itself. Each was
even dilatory and backward when its own special peril was urgent. These
embarrassments of the English did very much to compensate the French
for their great inferiority in numerical strength. We are again to remind
ourselves of the fact that the French, alike from their temperament and
their policy, were always vastly more congenial and influential with the
savages.</p>

<p>The French in Canada from the first adopted the policy of alliance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
native tribes. Though their warfare with the English was hardly intermittent,
there were several occasions when it was specially active. Beginning
with the first invasion of the Iroquois territory by Champlain, in 1609,
already mentioned, under the plea of espousing the side of his friends and
allies, the Hurons and Algonquins, other like enterprises were later pursued.
Courcelles, in 1666, made a wild and unsuccessful inroad upon the
Iroquois. Tracy made a more effective one in the same year. De la
Barre in 1684, Denonville in 1687, and Frontenac in 1693 and 1696, repeated
these onsets. The last of these invasions of what is now Central
New York was intended to effect the complete exhaustion of the Indian
confederacy. Its havoc was indeed well-nigh crushing, but there was a
tenacity and a recuperative power in that confederacy of savages which
yielded only to a like desolating blow inflicted by Sullivan, under orders
from Washington, in our Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>This formidable league of the Five Nations, when first known to Europeans,
claimed to have obtained by conquest the whole country from the
lakes to the Carolinas, and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. France,
as against other Europeans, though not against the Indians, claimed the
same territory. Great Britain claimed the valley of the Ohio and its tributaries,
first against the French as being merely the longitudinal extension
of the line of seacoast discovered by English navigators, and then through
cessions from and treaties with the Five Nations. The first of these
treaties was that made at Lancaster, Pa., in June, 1744. But the Indians
afterwards complained that they had been overreached, and had not intended
to cede any territory west of the Alleghanies. Here, of course,
with three parties in contention, there was basis enough for struggles in
which the prize, all considerations of natural justice being excluded, was to
be won only by superior power. Neither of the rivals and intruders from
across the ocean dealt with the Indians as if even they had any absolute
right to territory from which they claimed to have driven off former possessors.
So the Indian prerogative was recognized by the French and the
English as available only on either side for backing up some rival claim of
the one or the other nation; though when the mother-countries were at
peace in Europe, their subjects here by no means felt bound even to a
show of truce, and they were always most ready to avail themselves of a
declaration of war at home to make their wilderness campaigns. It is
curious to note that in all the negotiations between the Indians and Europeans,
including those of our own government, the only landed right recognized
as belonging to the savages was that of giving up territory. The
prior right of ownership by the tenure of possession was regarded as invalidated
both by the manner in which it had been acquired and by a lack to
make a good use of it.</p>

<p>It was in the closing years of the seventeenth century and in those opening
the eighteenth that the military and the priestly representatives of
France in Canada resolutely advised and undertook the measures which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
promised to give them a secure and extended possession of the whole north
of the continent, excepting only the strip on the Atlantic seaboard then
firmly held by the English colonists. Even this excepted region of territory
was by no means, however, regarded as positively irreclaimable, and
military enterprises were often planned with the aim of a complete extinction
of English possession. The French in their earliest explorations, in
penetrating the country to the west and to the south, had been keenly
observant in marking the strategic points on lake and river for strongholds
which should give them the advantage of single positions and secure a
chain of posts for easy and safe communications. Their leading object was
to gain an ascendency over the native tribes; and as they could not expect
easily and at once to get the mastery over them all, policy dictated such
a skilful turning to account of their feuds among themselves as would
secure strong alliances of interest and friendship with the more powerful
ones. The French did vastly more than the English to encourage the
passions of the savages for war and to train them in military skill and artifice,
leaving them for the most part unchecked in the indulgence of their
ferocity. It is true that the Dutch and the English had the start in supplying
the savages with firearms, under the excuse that they were needed by
the natives for the most effective support of the rapidly increasing trade in
peltries. But the French were not slow to follow the example, as it presented
to them a matter of necessity. And through the long and bloody
struggle between the two European nationalities with their red allies, it may
be safely affirmed that the frontier warfare of the English colonists was
waged against savages armed as well as led on by the French.</p>

<p>Two objects, generally harmonious and mutually helpful of each other,
inspired the activity of the French in taking possession successively of
posts in the interior of the continent. The first of these was the establishment
of mission stations for the conversion of the savages. The other
object of these wilderness posts was to secure the lucrative gains of the fur
trade from an ever-extending interior. Though, as was just said, these two
objects might generally be harmoniously pursued, it was not always found
easy or possible to keep them in amity, or to prevent sharp collisions between
them. There was a vigorous rivalry in the fur trade between the
members of an associated company, with a government monopoly for the
traffic, and very keenly enterprising individuals who pursued it, with but
little success in concealing their doings, in defiance of the monopolists.
The burden of the official correspondence between the authorities in Canada
and those at the French court related to the irregularities and abuses of
this traffic. Incident to these was a lively plying of the temptations of that
other traffic which poured into the wilderness floods of French brandy.
The taste of this fiery stimulant once roused in a savage could rarely afterwards
be appeased. The English colonists soon gained an advantage in
this traffic in their manufacture of cheap rum. It is easy to see how this
rivalry between monopolists and individuals in the fur trade, aided by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
stimulant for which the Indian was most craving, would impair the spiritual
labors of the priests at their wild stations. Nor were there lacking
instances in which the priests themselves were charged with sharing not
only the gains of the fur trade, but also those of the brandy traffic, either
in the interests of the monopolists or of individuals.</p>

<p>The earliest extended operations of the French fur trade with the Indians
were carried on by the northerly route to Lake Huron by the Ottawa River.
The French had little to apprehend from English interference by this difficult
route with its many portages. But it soon became of vital necessity
to the French to take and hold strong points on the line of the Great Lakes.
These were on the narrow streams which made the junctions between
them. So a fort was to be planted at Niagara, between Ontario and Erie;
another at Detroit, between Erie and Huron; another at Michilimackinac,
between Michigan and Huron; another at the fall of the waters of Superior
into Huron; and Fort St. Joseph, near the head of Lake Michigan, facilitated
communication with the Illinois and the Miami tribes; the Ojibwas,
Ottawas, Wyandots, and Pottawattomies having their settlements around
the westernmost of the lakes, the Sioux being still beyond. South of
Lake Erie, in the region afterwards known as the Northwest Territory,
between the Alleghanies, the Ohio, and the Mississippi, were the Delawares,
the Shawanees, and the Mingoes. It is to be kept in view that this territory,
though formally ceded by France to England in the treaty of 1762-63,
had previously been claimed by the English colonists as rightfully belonging
to their monarch, it being merely the undefined extension of the seacoast
held by virtue of the discovery of the Cabots.</p>

<p>The fifth volume of the <i>Mémoires</i> published by Margry gives us the original
documents, dating 1683-1695, relating to the first project for opening a
chain of posts to hold control of, and to facilitate communication between,
Canada and the west and south of the continent. The project was soon
made to extend its purpose to the Gulf of Mexico. The incursions of the
Iroquois and the attempted invasions of the English, with a consequent
drawing off of trade from the French, had obliged the Marquis Denonville
to abandon some of the posts that had been established. In spite of the
opposition of Champigny, Frontenac vigorously urged measures for the repossession
and strengthening of these posts. The Jesuits were earnest in
pressing the measure upon the governors of Canada. In pushing on the
enterprise, the French had sharp experience of the intense hostility of the
inner tribes who were to be encountered, and who were to be first conciliated.
The French followed a policy quite unlike that of the English in
the method of their negotiations for the occupancy of land. The colonists
of the latter aimed to secure by treaty and purchase the absolute fee and
ownership of a given region. They intended to hold it generally for cultivation,
and they expected the Indians then claiming it to vacate it. The
French beguiled the Indians by asserting that they had no intention either
of purchasing or forcibly occupying, as if it were their own, any spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
they established a stronghold, a trucking or a mission station. They professed
to hold only by sufferance, and that, too, simply for the security and
benefit of the natives, in furnishing them with a better religion than their
own and with the white man’s goods. The Iroquois, finding the hunting
and trapping of game for the English so profitable on their own territory,
were bent on extending their field. They hoped, by penetrating to Michilimackinac,
to make themselves the agents or medium for the trade with the
tribes near it, so that they could control the whole southern traffic. So
they had declared war against the Illinois, the Miamis, the Ottawas, and the
Hurons. It was of vital importance to the French to keep firm hold of
Lakes Ontario and Erie, and to guard their connections. The Iroquois
were always the threatening obstacle. It was affirmed that they had become
so debauched by strong drink that their squaws could not nourish their few
children, and that they had availed themselves of an adoption of those
taken from their enemies. As they obtained their firearms with comparative
cheapness from the English on the Hudson and Mohawk, they used
them with vigor against the inner tribes with their primitive weapons, and
were soon to find them of service against the English on the frontiers of
Virginia. So keenly did the English press their trade as to cause a wavering
of the loyalty of those Indian tribes who had been the first and the fast
friends of the French. Thus it was but natural that the Iroquois should
be acute enough to oppose the building of a French stronghold at any of
the selected posts.</p>

<p>In 1699,<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> La Mothe Cadillac proposed to assemble their red allies, then
much dispersed, and principally the Ottawas, at Detroit, and there to construct
both a fort and a village. At the bottom of this purpose, and of the
opposition to it, was a contention between rival parties in the traffic. The
favorers and the opponents of the design made their respective representations
to the French court. De Callières objected to the plan because of the
proximity of the hostile Iroquois, who would prefer to turn all the trade to
the English, and his preference was to reëstablish the old posts. The real
issue to be faced was whether the Indians now, and ultimately, were to be
made subjects of the English or of the French monarch. Cadillac combated
the objections of Callières, and succeeded in effecting his design at Detroit.
The extension of the traffic was constantly bringing into the field tribes
heretofore too remote for free intercourse. In each such case it depended
upon various contingencies to decide whether the French or the English
would find friends or foes in these new parties, and the alternative would
generally rest, temporarily at least, upon which party was most accessible
and most profitable for trade. It would hardly be worth the while for an
historian, unless dealing with the special theme of the rivalries involved
in the fur trade as deciding with which party of the whites one or another
tribe came into amity, to attempt to trace the conditions and consequences
of such diplomacy in inconstant negotiators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>The English began the series of attempts to bind the Five, afterwards
the Six, Nations into amity or neutrality by treaty in 1674. These treaties
were wearisome in their formalities, generally unsatisfactory in their terms
of assurance, and so subject to caprice and the changes of fortune as to need
confirmation and renewal, as suspicion or alleged treachery on either side
made them practically worthless. There were two ends to be gained by
these treaties of the English with the confederated tribes. The one was
to avert hostilities from the English and to secure them privileges of transit
for trade. The other object, not always avowed, but implied as a
natural consequent of the first, was to alienate the tribes from the French,
and if possible to keep them in a state of local or general conflict. Each
specification of these treaties was to be emphasized by the exchange of a
wampum belt. Then a largess of presents, always including rum, was the
final ratification. These goods were of considerable cost to the English,
but always seemed a niggard gift to the Indians, as there were so many to
share in them.</p>

<p>The first of this series of treaties was that made in 1674, at Albany, by
Col. Henry Coursey, in behalf of the colonists of Virginia. It was of little
more service than as it initiated the parties into the method of such proceedings.</p>

<p>In the middle of July, 1684, Lord Howard, governor of Virginia, summoned
a council of the sachems of the Five Nations to Albany. He was
attended by two of his council and by Governor Dongan of New York,
and some of the magistrates of Albany. Howard charged upon the savages
the butcheries and plunderings which they had committed seven years
previous in Virginia and Maryland, “belonging to the great king of England.”
He told the sachems that the English had intended at once to
avenge those outrages, but through the advice of Sir Edmund Andros,
then governor-general of the country, had sent peaceful messengers to
them. The sachems had proved perfidious to the pledges they then gave,
and the governor, after threatening them, demanded from them conditions
of future amity. After their usual fashion of shifting responsibility and
professions of regret and future fidelity, the sachems renewed their covenants.
Under the prompting of Governor Dongan they asked that the
Duke of York’s arms should be placed on the Mohawk castles, as a protection
against their enemies, the French. Doubtless the Indians, in desiring,
or perhaps only assenting to, the affixing of these English insignia to their
strongholds, might have had in view only the effect of them in warning off
the French. They certainly did not realize that their English guests
would ever afterwards, as they did, regard this concession of the tribes as
an avowal of allegiance to the king of Great Britain, and as adopting for
themselves the relation of subjects of a foreign monarch.</p>

<p>The experience gained by many previous attempts to secure the fidelity
of the tribes, thenceforward known as the Six Nations by the incorporation
into the confederacy of the remnant of the Tuscaroras, was put to service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
in three succeeding councils for treaty-making, held respectively at Philadelphia
in 1742, in Lancaster, Pa., in 1744,<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> and at Albany in 1746.<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> Much
allowance is doubtless to be made in the conduct of the earlier treaties
for the lack of competent and faithful interpreters in councils made up
of representatives of several tribes, with different languages and idioms.
Interpreters have by no means always proved trustworthy, even when
qualified for their office.<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> The difficulty was early experienced of putting
into our simple mother-tongue the real substance of an Indian harangue,
which was embarrassed and expanded by images and flowers of native
rhetoric, wrought from the structure of their symbolic language, but adding
nothing to the terms or import of the address. It was observed that often
an interpreter, anxious only to state the gist of the matter in hand, would
render in a single English sentence an elaborately ornate speech of an
orator that had extended through many minutes in its utterance. The
orator might naturally mistrust whether full justice had been done to his
plea or argument. There is by no means a unanimity in the opinions or
the judgments of those of equal intelligence, who have reported to us the
harangues of Indians in councils, as to the qualities of their eloquence or
rhetoric. The entire lack of terms for the expression of abstract ideas
compelled them to draw their illustrations from natural objects and relations.
Signs and gestures made up a large part of the significance of a
discourse. Doubtless the cases were frequent in which the representation
of a tribe in a council was made through so few of its members that there
might be reasonable grounds for objection on the part of a majority to the
terms of any covenant or treaty that had been made by a chief or an orator.
Of one very convenient and plausible subterfuge, or honest plea,&mdash;whichever
in any given case it might have been,&mdash;our native tribes have
always been skilful in availing themselves. The assumption was that the
elder, the graver, wiser representatives of a tribe were those who appeared
on its behalf at a council. When circumstances afterwards led the whites
to complain of a breach of the conditions agreed on, the blame was always
laid by the chiefs on their “young men,” whom they had been unable to
restrain.</p>

<p>During the long term of intermittent warfare of the French and English
on this continent, with native tribes respectively for their foes or allies, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>conditions of the conflict, as before hinted, were in general but slightly
affected by the alternative of peace or war as existing at any time between
their sovereigns and people in Europe. Some of the fiercest episodes of
the struggle on this soil took place during the intervals of truce, armistice,
and temporary treaty settlements between the leading powers in the old
world. When, in the treaties closing a series of campaigns, the settlement
in the articles of peace included a restoration of the territory which had
been obtained by either party by conquest, no permanent result was really
secured. These restitutions were always subject to reclamation. Valuable
and strategic points of territory merely changed hands for the time being;
Acadia, for example, being seven times tossed as a shuttlecock between
the parties to the settlement. The trial had to be renewed and repeated
till the decision was of such a sort as to give promise of finality. The
prize contended for here was really the mastery of the whole continent,
though the largeness of the stake was not appreciated till the closing years
of the struggle. Indeed, the breadth and compass of the field were then unknown
quantities. Those closing years of stratagem and carnage in our forests
correspond to what is known in history as the “Seven Years’ War” in
Europe, in which France, as a contestant, was worsted in the other quarters
of the globe, as in this. Clive broke her power in India, as the generals of
Britain discomfited her here. The French, in 1758, held a profitable mercantile
settlement on five hundred miles of coast in Africa, between Cape
Blanco and the river Gambia. It is one of the curious contrarieties in
the workings of the same avowed principles under different conditions,
that just at the time that the pacific policy of the Pennsylvania Quakers
forbade their offering aid to their countrymen under the bloody work going
on upon their frontiers, an eminent English Quaker merchant, Thomas
Cumming, framed the successful scheme of conquest over this French
settlement in Africa.<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a></p>

<p>The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, seemed to promise a breathing-time
in the strife between the French and English here. In fact, however,
so far from there being even a smouldering of the embers on our soil, that
date marks the kindling of the conflagration which, continuing to blaze for
fifteen years onward, comprehended all the decisive campaigns. The
earliest of these were ominous and disheartening to the English, but they
closed with the fullness of triumph. We must trace with conciseness the
more prominent acts and incidents in which the natives, with the French
and English, protracted and closed the strife.</p>

<p>When Europeans entered upon the region now known as Pennsylvania,
though its well-watered and fertile territory and its abounding game would
seem to have well adapted it to the uses of savage life, it does not appear
that it was populously occupied. The Delawares, which had held it at an
earlier period, had, previously to the coming of the whites, been subjugated
by the more warlike tribes of the Five Nations, or Iroquois. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
vanquished had passed to the south or west, to be merged in other bands of
the natives. Such of them as remained in their old haunts were humiliated
by their masters, despised as “women,” and denied the privileges of warriors.
While the Five Nations were thus potent in the upper portion of
Pennsylvania, around the sources of the Susquehanna, its southern region
was held by the Shawanees. The first purchase near the upper region
made by Europeans of the natives was by a colony of Swedes, under Governor
John Printz, in 1643. This colony was subdued, though allowed to
remain on its lands, by the Dutch, in 1655. In 1664, the English took
possession of all Pennsylvania, and of everything that had been held by the
Dutch. Penn founded his province in 1682, by grant from Charles II.,
and in the next year made his much-lauded treaty of peace and purchase
with the Indians for lands west and north of his city. The attractions of
the province, and the easy opening of its privileges to others than the
Friends, drew to it a rapid and enterprising immigration. In 1729 there
came in, principally from the north of Ireland, 6,207 settlers. In 1750
there arrived 4,317 Germans and 1,000 English. The population of the
province in 1769 was estimated at 250,000. The Irish settlers were mostly
Presbyterians, the Germans largely Moravians. It soon appeared, especially
when the ravages of the Indians on the frontiers were most exasperating
and disastrous, that there were elements of bitter discord between
these secondary parties in the province and the Friends who represented
the proprietary right. And this suggests a brief reference to the fact that,
as a very effective agent entering into the imbittered conflicts of the time
and scene, we are to take into the account some strong religious animosities.
The entailed passions and hates of the peoples of the old world, as Catholics
and Protestants, and even of sects among the latter, were transferred here to
inflame the rage of combatants in wilderness warfare.<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> The zeal and heroic
fidelity of the French priests in making a Christian from a baptized and
untamed savage had realized, under rude yet easy conditions, a degree of
success. In and near the mission stations, groups of the natives had been
trained to gather around the cross, and to engage with more or less response
in the holy rites. Some of them could repeat, after a fashion, the
Pater Noster, the Ave Maria, and the Creed. Some had substituted a
crucifix or a consecrated medal for their old pagan charm, to be worn on
the breast. When about to go forth on the war-path, their priests would
give them shrift and benediction. But, as has been said, it was no part or
purpose of this work of christianizing savages to impair their qualities as
warriors, to dull their knives or tomahawks, to quench their thirst for blood,
or to restrain the fiercest atrocities and barbarities of the fight or the victory.
On the well-known experience that fresh converts are always the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
most ardent haters of heresy, these savage neophytes were initiated into
some of the mysteries of the doctrinal strife between the creed of their
priests and the abominated infidelity and impiety of the English Protestants.
Some of the savages were by no means slow to learn the lesson.
Mr. Parkman’s brilliant and graphic pages afford us abounding illustrations
of the part which priestly instructions and influence had in adding to savage
ferocity the simulation of religious hate for heresy. With whatever degree
of understanding or appreciation of the duty as it quickened the courage or
the ferocity of the savage, there were many scenes and occasions in which
the warrior added the charge of heretic to that of enemy, when he dealt
his blow.<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a></p>

<p>Almost as violent and exasperating were the animosities engendered
between the disciples of different Protestant fellowships. The Quakers,
backed by proprietary rights, by the prestige of an original peace policy
and friendly negotiations with the Indians, and for the most part secure and
unharmed in the centralized homes of Philadelphia and its neighborhood,
imagined that they might refuse all participation in the bloody work enacting
on their frontiers. The adventurous settlers on the borders were largely
Presbyterians. The course of non-interference by the Quakers, who controlled
the legislature, seemed to those who were bearing the brunt of
savage warfare monstrously selfish and inhuman. There was a fatuity in
this course which had to be abandoned. When a mob of survivors from
the ravaged fields and cabins of the frontiers, bringing in cartloads of the
bones gathered from the ashes of their burned dwellings, thus enforced
their remonstrances against the peace policy of the legislature, the Quakers
were compelled to yield, and to furnish the supplies of war.<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> But sectarian
hatred hardly ever reached an intenser glow than that exhibited between
the Pennsylvania Quakers and Presbyterians. Meanwhile, the mild and
kindly missionary efforts of the Moravians, in the same neighborhood, were
cruelly baffled. Their aim was exactly the opposite of that which guided
the Jesuit priests. They sought first to make their converts human beings,
planters of the soil, taught in various handicrafts, and weaned from the
taste of war and blood.</p>

<p>When the frontier war was at its wildest pitch of havoc and fury, the
Moravian settlements, which had reached a stage giving such promise of
success as to satisfy the gentle and earnest spirit of the missionaries who
had planted them, were made to bear the brunt of the rage of all the parties
engaged in the deadly turmoil. The natives timidly nestling in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
settlements were regarded as an emasculated flock of nurslings, mean and
cowardly, lacking equally the manhood of the savage and the pride and
capacity of the civilized man. Worse than this, their pretended desire to
preserve a neutrality and to have no part in the broil was made the ground
of a suspicion, at once acted upon as if fully warranted, that they were
really spies, offering secret information and even covert help as guides and
prompters in the work of desolation among the scattered cabins of the
whites. So a maddened spirit of distrust, inflamed by false rumors and
direct charges of complicity, brought upon the Moravian settlers the hate
and fury of the leading parties in the conflict.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the most furious havoc of savage warfare should have
been wreaked on the frontiers of Pennsylvania, the one of all the English
colonies in America whose boast was, and is, that there alone the entrance
of civilized men upon the domains of barbarism was marked and initiated by
the Christian policy of peace and righteousness. Penn and his representatives
claimed that they had twice paid the purchase price of the lands covered
by the proprietary charter to the Indian occupants of them,&mdash;once to
the Delawares residing upon them, and again to the Iroquois who held
them by conquest. The famous “Walking Purchase,” whether a fair or a
fraudulent transaction, was intended to follow the original policy of the
founder of the province.<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a></p>

<p>In the inroads made upon the English settlements by Frontenac and his
red allies, New York and New England furnished the victims. The middle
colonies, so far as then undertaken, escaped the fray. Trouble began for
them in 1716, when the French acted upon their resolve to occupy the
valley of the Ohio. The Ohio Land Company was formed in 1748 to
advance settlements beyond the Alleghanies, and surveys were made as
far as Louisville. This enterprise roused anew the Indians and the French.
The latter redoubled their zeal in 1753 and onward, south of Lake Erie
and on the branches of the Ohio. The English found that their delay and
dilatoriness in measures for fortifying the frontiers had given the French
an advantage which was to be recovered only with increased cost and
enterprise. In an earlier movement, had the English engaged their efforts
when it was first proposed to them, they might have lessened, at least,
their subsequent discomfiture. Governor Spotswood, of Virginia, in 1720
had urged on the British government the erection of a chain of posts beyond
the Alleghanies, from the lakes to the Mississippi. But his urgency
had been ineffectual. The governor reported that there were then “Seven
Tributary Tribes” in Virginia, being seven hundred in number, with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
hundred and fifty fighting-men, all of whom were peaceful. His only
trouble was from the Tuscaroras on the borders of Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a></p>

<p>The erection of Fort Duquesne may be regarded as opening the decisive
struggle between the French and the English in America, which reached
its height in 1755, and centred around the imperfect chain of stockades
and blockhouses on the line of the frontiers then reached by the English
pioneers.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century the number of French subjects
in America, including Acadia, Canada, and Louisiana, was estimated
at about eighty thousand. The subjects of England were estimated at
about twelve hundred thousand. But, as before remarked, this vast disparity
of numbers by no means represented an equal difference in the
effectiveness of the two nationalities in the conduct of military movements.
The French were centralized in command. They had unity of purpose
and in action. In most cases they held actual defensive positions at points
which the English had to reach by difficult approaches; and more than all,
till it became evident that France was to lose the game, the French received
much the larger share of aid from the Indians. Pennsylvania and
Virginia were embarrassed in any attempt for united defensive operations
on the frontiers by their own rival claims to the Ohio Valley. The English,
however, welcomed the first signs of vacillation in the savages. When
Céloron, in 1749, had sent messengers to the Indians beyond the Alleghanies
to prepare for the measures he was about to take to secure a firm foothold
there, he reported that the natives were “devoted entirely to the
English.” This might have seemed true of the Delawares and Shawanees,
though soon afterwards these were found to be in the interest of the
French. In fact, all the tribes, except the Five Nations, may be regarded
as more or less available for French service up to the final extinction of
their power on the continent. Indeed, as we shall see, the mischievous
enmity of the natives against the English was never more vengeful than
when it was goaded on by secret French agency after France had by
treaty yielded her claims on this soil. Nor could even the presumed neutrality
of the Five Nations be relied upon by the English, as there were
reasons for believing that many among them acted as spies and conveyed
intelligence. Till after the year 1754 so effective had been the activity of
the French in planting their strongholds and winning over the savages
that there was not a single English post west of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>At the same critical stage of this European rivalry in military operations,
the greed for the profits of the fur trade was at its highest pitch. The
beavers, as well as the red men, should be regarded as essential parties to
the struggle between the French and the English. The latter had cut very
deep into the trade which had formerly accrued wholly to the French at
Oswego, Toronto, and Niagara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the year 1720 there had come to be established a mercantile
usage which had proved to be very prejudicial to the English, alike in their
Indian trade and in their influence over the Indians. The French had
been allowed to import goods into New York to be used for their Indian
trade. Of course this proved a very profitable business, as it facilitated
their operations and was constantly extending over a wider reach their
friendly relations with the farther tribes. Trade with Europe and the
West Indies and Canada could be maintained only by single voyages in a
year, through the perilous navigation of the St. Lawrence. With the English
ports on the Atlantic, voyages could be made twice or thrice a year.
A few merchants in New York, having a monopoly of supplying goods to
the French in Canada, with their principals in England, had found their
business very profitable. Goods of prime value, especially “strouds,” a
kind of coarse woollen cloth highly prized by the Indians, were made in
and exported from England much more cheaply than from France. The
mischief of this method of trade being realized, an act was passed by the
Assembly in New York, in 1720, which prohibited the selling of Indian
goods to the French under severe penalties, in order to the encouragement
of trade in general, and to the extension of the influence of the English
over the Indians to counterbalance that of the French. Some merchants
in London, just referred to, petitioned the king against the ratification
of this act. By order in council the king referred the petition to the
Lords of Trade and Plantations. A hearing, with testimonies, followed, in
which those interested in the monopoly made many statements, ignorant
or false, as to the geography of the country, and the method and effects of
the advantage put into the hands of the French. But the remonstrants
failed to prevent the restricting measure. From that time New York
vastly extended its trade and intercourse with the tribes near and distant,
greatly to the injury of the French.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a></p>

<p>The first white man’s dwelling in Ohio was that of the Moravian missionary,
Christian Frederic Post.<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> He was a sagacious and able man, and
had acquired great influence over the Indians, which he used in conciliatory
ways, winning their respect and confidence by the boldness with which he
ventured to trust himself in their villages and lodges, as if he were under
some magical protection. He went on his first journey to the Ohio in
1758, by request of the government of Pennsylvania, on a mission to the
Delawares, Shawanees, and Mingoes. These had once been friendly to the
English, but having been won over by the French, the object was to regain
their confidence. The tribes had at this time come to understand, in
a thoroughly practical way, that they were restricted to certain limited conditions
so far as they were parties to the fierce rivalry between the Europeans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
The issue was no longer an open one as to their being able to
reclaim their territory for their own uses by driving off all these pale-faced
trespassers. It was for them merely to choose whether they would henceforward
have the French or the English for neighbors, and, if it must be
so, for masters. Nor were they left with freedom or power to make a deliberate
choice. But Post certainly stretched a point when he told the
Indians that the English did not wish to occupy their lands, but only to
drive off the French.</p>

<p>As Governor Spotswood, in the interest of Virginia, had attempted, in
1716, to break the French line of occupation by promoting settlements in
the west, Governor Keith, of Pennsylvania, followed with a similar effort
in 1719. Both efforts could be only temporarily withstood, and if baffled
at one point were renewed at another. The English always showed a
tenacity in clinging to an advance once made, and were inclined to change
it only for a further advance. Though Fort Duquesne was blown up when
abandoned by the French, with the hope of rendering it useless to the
English, the post was too commanding a one to be neglected. After it
had been taken by General Forbes in November, 1758, and had been
strongly reconstructed by General Stanwix, though it was then two hundred
miles distant from the nearest settlement, the possession of it was to
a great extent the deciding fact of the advancing struggle. Colonel Armstrong
had taken the Indian town of Kittanning in 1756.</p>

<p>The treaty negotiations between English and French diplomates at a
foreign court, in 1763, which covenanted for the surrender of all territory
east of the Mississippi and of all the fortified posts on lake and river to
Great Britain, was but a contract on paper, which was very long in finding
its full ratification among the parties alone interested in the result here.
There were still three of these parties: the Indians; the French, who were
in possession of the strongholds in the north and west; and the English
colonists, supported by what was left of the British military forces, skeleton
regiments and invalided soldiers, who were to avail themselves of their acquired
domain. During the bloody and direful war which had thus been
closed, the Indians had come to regard themselves as holding the balance
of power between the French and the English. Often did the abler savage
warriors express alike their wonder and their rage that those foreign
intruders should choose these wild regions for the trial of their fighting
powers. “Why do you not settle your fierce quarrels in your own land,
or at least upon the sea, instead of involving us and our forests in your
rivalry?” was the question to the officers and the file of the European
forces. Though the natives soon came to realize that they would be the
losers, whichever of the two foreign parties should prevail, their preferences
were doubtless on the side of the French; and by force of circumstances
easily explicable, after the English power, imperial and provincial,
had obtained the mastery of the territory, the sympathies and aid of the
natives went with the British during the rebellion of the colonies. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
before this result was reached England won its ascendency at a heavy
sacrifice of men and money, in a series of campaigns under many different
generals. The general peace between England, France, and Spain, secured
by the treaty of 1763, and involving the cession of all American territory
east of the Mississippi by France to Britain, was naturally expected to
bring a close to savage warfare against the colonists. The result was quite
the contrary, inasmuch as the sharpest and most desolating havoc was
wrought by that foe after the English were nominally left alone to meet
the encounter. The explanation of this fact was that the French, though
by covenant withdrawn from the field, were, hardly even with a pretence
of secrecy, perpetuating and even extending their influence over their
former wild allies in embarrassing and thwarting all the schemes of the
English for turning their conquests to account. General Amherst was
left in command here with only enfeebled fragments of regiments and
with slender ranks of provincials. The military duty of the hour was for
the conquerors to take formal possession of all the outposts still held by
French garrisons, announcing to those in command the absolute conditions
of the treaty, and to substitute the English for the French colors, henceforward
to wave over them. This humiliating necessity was in itself
grievous enough, as it forced upon the commanders of posts which had
not then been reached by the war in Canada, a condition against which no
remonstrance would avail. But beyond that, it furnished the occasion for
the most formidable savage conspiracy ever formed on this continent,
looking to the complete extinction of the English settlements here. The
French in those extreme western posts had been most successful in securing
the attachment of the neighboring Indian tribes, and found strong
sympathizers among them in their discomfiture. At the same time those
tribes had the most bitter hostility towards the English with whom they
had come in contact. They complained that the English treated them
with contempt and haughtiness, being niggard of their presents and sharp
in their trade. They regarded each advanced English settlement on their
lands, if only that of a solitary trader, as the germ of a permanent colony.
Under these circumstances, the French still holding the posts, waiting only
the exasperating summons to yield them up, found the temptation strong
and easy of indulgence to inflame their recent allies, and now their sympathizing
friends, among the tribes, with an imbittered rage against their new
masters. Artifice and deception were availed of to reinforce the passions
of savage breasts. The French sought to relieve the astounded consternation
of their red friends on finding that they were compelled to yield the
field to the subjects of the English monarch, by beguiling them with the
fancy that the concession was but a temporary one, very soon to be set
aside by a new turn in the wheel of fortune. Their French father had
only fallen asleep while his English enemies had been impudently trespassing
upon the lands of his red children. He would soon rouse himself to
avenge the insult, and would reclaim what he had thus lost. Indeed, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
principle that the size and ornamentings of a lie involved no additional
wrong in the telling it, the Indians were informed that a French army was
even then preparing to ascend the Mississippi with full force, before which
the English would be crushed.</p>

<p>There was then in the tribe of Ottawas, settled near Detroit, a master
spirit, who, as a man and as a chief, was the most sagacious, eloquent, bold,
and every way gifted of his race that has ever risen before the white man
on this continent to contest in the hopeless struggle of barbarism with
civilization. That Pontiac was crafty, unscrupulous, relentless, finding a
revel in havoc and carnage, might disqualify him for the noblest epithets
which the white man bestows on the virtues of a military hero. But he
had the virtues of a savage, all of them, and in their highest range of
nature and of faculty. He was a stern philosopher and moralist also, of
the type engendered by free forest life, unsophisticated and trained in the
school of the wilderness. He knew well the attractions of civilization. He
weighed and compared them, as they presented themselves before his eyes
in full contrast with savagery, in the European and in the Indian, and in
those dubious specimens of humanity in which the line of distinction was
blurred by the Indianized white man, the “Christian” convert, and the
half-breed. Deliberately and, we may say, intelligently, he preferred for his
own people the state of savagery. Intelligently, because he gave grounds
for his preference, which, from his point of view and experience, had weight
in themselves, and cannot be denied something more than plausibility even
in the judgment of civilized men, for idealists like Rousseau and the Abbé
Raynal have pleaded for them. Pontiac was older in native sagacity and
shrewdness than in years. He had evidence enough that his race had
suffered only harm from intercourse with the whites. The manners and
temptations of civilization had affected them only by demoralizing influences.
All the elements of life in the white man struck at what was
noblest in the nature of the Indian,&mdash;his virility, his self-respect, his proud
and sufficing independence, his content with his former surroundings and
range of life. With an earnest eloquence Pontiac, in the lodges and at
the council fires of his people, whether of his own immediate tribe or of
representative warriors of other tribes, set before them the demonstration
that security and happiness, if not peace, depended for them on their
renouncing all reliance upon the white man’s ways and goods, and reverting
with a stern stoicism to the former conditions of their lot. He told
his responsive listeners that the Great Spirit, in pouring the wide salt
waters between the two races of his children, meant to divide them and to
keep them forever apart, giving to each of them a country which was their
own, where they were free to live after their own method. The different
tinting of their skin indicated a variance which testified to a rooted divergence
of nature. For his red children the Great Spirit had provided the
forest, the meadow, the lake, and the river, with fish and game for food
and clothing. The canoe, the moccasin, the snow-shoe, the stone axe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
hide or bark covered lodge, the fields of golden maize, the root crops, the
vines and berries, the waters of the cold crystal spring, made the inventory
of their possessions. They belonged to nature, and were of kin to all its
other creatures, which they put freely to their use, holding everything in
common. The changing moons brought round the seasons for planting
and hunting, for game, festivity, and religious rite. Their old men preserved
the sacred traditions of their race. Their braves wore the scars and
trophies of a noble manhood, and their young men were in training to be
the warriors of their tribes in defence or conquest.</p>

<p>These, argued Pontiac, were the heritage which the Great Spirit had assigned
to his red children. The spoiler had come among them from across
the salt sea, and woe and ruin for the Indian had come with him. The
white man could scorn the children of the forest, but could not be their
friend or helper. Let the Indian be content and proud to remain an Indian.
Let him at once renounce all use of the white man’s goods and implements
and his fire-water, and fall back upon the independence of nature,
fed on the flesh and clothed with the skins secured by bow and arrow and
his skill of woodcraft.</p>

<p>Such was the pleading of the most gifted chieftain and the wisest patriot,
the native product of the American wilderness. There was a nobleness in
him, even a grandeur and prescience of soul, which take a place now on the
list of protests that have poured from human breasts against the decrees of
fate. Pontiac followed up his bold scheme by all the arts and appliances
of forest diplomacy. He formed his cabinet, and sent out his ambassadors
with their credentials in the reddened hatchet and the war-belt. They
visited some of even the remoter tribes, with appeals conciliatory of all
minor feuds and quarrels. Their success was qualified only by the inveteracy
of existing enmities among some of these tribes. It would be difficult
to estimate, even if only approximately, the number of the savages who
were more or less directly engaged in the conspiracy of Pontiac. A noted
French trader, who had resided many years among the Indians, and who
had had an extended intercourse with the tribes, stayed at Detroit during
the siege, having taken the oath of allegiance to the king of Great Britain.
Largely from his own personal knowledge, he drew up an elaborate list of
the tribes, with the number of warriors in each. The summing up of these
is 56,500. In the usual way of allowing one to five of a whole population
for able-bodied men, this would represent the number of the savages as
about 283,000, which slightly exceeds the number of Indians now in our
national domain.<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a></p>

<p>The lake and river posts which had been yielded up by the French, on
the summons, were occupied by slender and poorly supplied English garrisons,
unwarned of the impending concentration. The scheme of Pontiac
involved two leading acts in the drama: one was the beleaguerment of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the fortified lake and river garrisons; the other was an extermination by
fire and carnage of all the isolated frontier settlements at harvest time,
so as to cause general starvation. The plan was that all these assaults,
respectively assigned to bodies of the allies, should be made at the same
time, fixed by a phase of the moon. Scattered through the wilderness
were many English traders, in their cabins and with their packh-orses and
goods. These were plundered and massacred.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> The assailed posts were
slightly reinforced by the few surviving settlers and traders who escaped
the open field slaughter. The conspiracy was so far effective as to paralyze
with dismay the occupants of the whole region which it threatened. But
pluck and endurance proved equal to the appalling conflict. Nearly all the
posts, after various alternations of experience, succumbed to the savage foe.
Such was the fate of Venango, Le Bœuf, Presqu’ Isle, La Bay, St. Joseph,
Miamis, Ouachtanon, Sandusky, and Michilimackinac. Detroit alone held
out. The fort at Niagara, being very strong, was not attacked. The
Shawanees and Delawares were active agents in this conspiracy. The
English used all their efforts and appliances to keep the Six Nations neutral.
The French near the Mississippi were active in plying and helping
the tribes within their reach. The last French flag that came down on our
territory was at Fort Chartres on the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a></p>

<p class="pc"><i>By Dr. Ellis and the Editor.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap06">ON some few historical subjects we have volumes
so felicitously constructed as to combine
all that is most desirable in original materials
with a judicious digest of them. Of such
a character is Francis Parkman’s <i>France and
England in North America, A Series of Historical
Narratives</i>. So abundant, authentic, and intelligently
gathered are his citations from and references
to the journals, letters, official reports, and
documents, often in the very words of the actors,
that, through the writer’s luminous pages, we
are, for all substantial purposes, made to read
and listen to their own narrations. Indeed, we
are even more favored than that. So comprehensive
have been his researches, and so full
and many-sided are the materials which he has
digested for us, that we have all the benefit of
an attendance on a trial in a court or a debate
in the forum, where by testimony and cross-examination
different witnesses are made to verify
or rectify their separate assertions. The official
representatives of France, military and civil, on
this continent, like their superiors and patrons
at home, were by no means all of one mind.
They had their conflicting interests to serve.
They made their reports to those to whom they
were responsible or sought to influence, and so
colored them by their selfishness or rivalry.
These communications, gathered from widely
scattered repositories, are for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
brought together and made to confront each
other in Mr. Parkman’s pages. Allowing for a
gap covering the first half of the eighteenth
century, which is yet to be filled, Mr. Parkman’s
series of volumes deals with the whole period of
the enterprise of France in the new world to its
cession of all territory east of the Mississippi to
Great Britain. His marvellously faithful and
skilful reproduction of the scenic features of the
continent, in its wild state, bears a fit relation
to his elaborate study of its red denizens. His
wide and arduous exploration in the tracks of
the first pioneers, and his easy social relations
with the modern representatives of the aboriginal
stock, put him back into the scenes and
companionship of those whose schemes and
achievements he was to trace historically. After
identifying localities and lines of exploration
here, he followed up in foreign archives the missives
written in these forests, and the official
and confidential communications of the military
and civic functionaries of France, revealing the
joint or conflicting schemes and jealousies of
intrigue or selfishness of priests, traders, monopolists,
and adventurers. The panorama that
is unrolled and spread before us is full and
complete, lacking nothing of reality in nature
or humanity, in color, variety, or action. The
volumes rehearse in a continuous narrative the
course of French enterprise here, the motives,
immediate and ultimate, which were had in view,
the progress in realizing them, the obstacles and
resistance encountered, and the tragic failure.<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a></p>

<p>The references in Parkman show that he
depends more upon French than upon English
sources, and indeed he seems to give the chief
credit for his drawing of the early Indian life
and character to the <i>Relations</i> of the French
and Italian Jesuits,<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> during their missionary
work in New France.</p>

<p>We must class with these records of the
Jesuits, though not equalling them in value,
the volumes of Champlain, Sagard, Creuxius,
Boucher,<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> and the later Lafitau and Charlevoix.
Parkman<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> tells us that no other of these early
books is so satisfactory as Lafitau’s <i>Mœurs des
Sauvages</i> (1724); and Charlevoix gave similar
testimony regarding his predecessor.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> For
original material on the French side we have
nothing to surpass in interest the <i>Mémoires et
documents</i>, published by Pierre Margry, of
which an account has been given elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> as
well as of the efforts of Parkman and others in
advancing their publication.<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> There is but little
matter in these volumes relating to the military
operations which make the subject of this chapter,
though jealousy and rivalry of the schemes
of the English, and the necessity of efforts to
thwart them in their attempts to gain influence
and to open trade with the Indians, are constantly
recognized. In the diplomatic and military
movements which opened on this continent
the Seven Years’ War, the English, who had substantially
secured the alliance of the Iroquois,
or the Six Nations, insisted that they had obtained
by treaties with them the territory between
the Alleghanies and the Ohio, which the
Six Nations on their part claimed to have gained
by conquest and cession of the tribes that had
previously occupied it. But when the English
vindicated their entrance on the territory on the
basis of these treaties with the Six Nations, the
Shawanees and the Delawares, having recuperated
their courage and vigor, denied this right
by conquest. The French could not claim a
right either by conquest or by cession. Their
assumed occupancy and tenure through mission
stations and strongholds were maintained simply
and wholly on grounds of discovery and exploration.
Margry’s volumes furnish the abundant
and all-sufficient evidence of the priority of the
French in this enterprise. The official documents
interchanged with the authorities at home
are all engaged with advice and promptings and
measures for making good the claim to dominion
founded on discovery. These volumes also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
are of the highest value as presenting to us from
the first explorers, every way intelligent and
competent as observers and reporters, the scenes
and tenants of the interior of the continent.
Here we have the wilderness, its primeval forests,
its sea-like lakes, its threading rivers,
shrunken or swollen, its cataracts and its confluent
streams, its marshy expanses, bluffs, and
plains, and its resources, abundant or scant, for

feature or full portrayal by the charming skill of
those to whom the sight was novel and bewildering.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a>
These French explorers will henceforth
serve for all time as primary authorities on the
features and resources of the interior of this
continent just before it became the prize in contest
between rival European nationalities. That
contest undoubtedly had more to do in deciding
the fate of the savage tribes from that time to
our own. There are many reasons for believing
that if the French had been able to hold alone
an undisputed dominion in the interior of the
continent, their relations with the Indian tribes,
if not wholly pacific, would have been far more
amicable than those which followed upon the
hot rivalry with the English for the possession
of their territories. The French were the wiser,
the more tolerant and friendly of the two, in
their intercourse with and treatment of the savages,
with whom they found it so easy to affiliate.
Under other circumstances the Indians might
have come to hold the relation of <i>wards</i> to the
French in a sense far more applicable than that
in which the term has been used by the government
of the United States.</p>

<p>Of the early English material there is no
dearth, but it hardly has the same stamp of
authority. The story of the Moravian and other
missions on the Protestant and English side has
less of such invariable devotedness and success
than is recorded in the general summaries of the
Jesuit and Recollet missions, like Shea’s <i>History
of the Catholic Missions</i>, 1529-1854 (N. Y., 1855).<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a>

they yield to the superior efficacy of the French.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>
Among the English administrative officers, the
lead must doubtless be given to Sir William
Johnson, for his personal influence over the Indian
mind, winning their full confidence by fair
and generous treatment of them, by a free hospitality,
by assimilating with their habits even in
his array, and by mastering their language. His
deputy, Col. George Croghan, as interpreter and
messenger, was kept busily employed in constant
tramps through the woods, and in fearless
errands to parties of vacillating or hostile tribes,
to hold or win them to the English interest.
The principal and the deputy, in this hazardous
diplomacy, were specially qualified for their office
by having mastered the gift and qualities
of Indian oratory, by a familiarity with Indian
character in its strength and weakness, and by
endeavoring to keep faith with them, and to
imitate the adroit methods of the French rather
than the contemptuous hauteur of most of the
English in intercourse with them.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a></p>

<p>The reader will naturally go to the biographies
of Johnson, Washington, and the other
military leaders of their time, to those of a few
civilians, like Franklin, and to the general histories
of the French and Indian wars and of
their separate campaigns, for much light upon
the Indian in war; and these materials have
been sufficiently explored in another volume of
the present History.<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> These more general accounts
are easily supplemented in the narratives
of adventures and sufferings by a large
class of persons who fell captive to the Indians,
and lived to tell their tales.<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a></p>

<p>The earlier travellers, like P. E. Radisson,<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a>

Carver,<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> not to name others; the later ones, like
Prinz Maximilian;<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> the experiences of various
army officers on the frontiers, like Randolph B.
Marcy<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> and J. B. Fry,<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>&mdash;all such books fill in
the picture in some of its details.</p>

<p>The early life in the Ohio Valley was particularly
conducive to such auxiliary helps in
this study, and we owe more of this kind of
illustration to Joseph Doddridge<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> than to any
other. He was a physician and a missionary of
the Protestant Episcopal Church, and in both
his professions a man highly esteemed. He was
born in Maryland in 1769, and in his fourth year
removed with his family to the western border
of the line between Pennsylvania and Virginia.
With abundant opportunities in his youth of
familiarity with the rudest experiences of frontier
life near hostile Indians, he was a keen observer,
a skilful narrator, and a diligent gatherer-up
of historical and traditional lore from the
hardy and well-scarred pioneers. He had received
a good academic and medical education,
and was a keen student of nature as well as of
humanity. His pages give us most vivid pictures
of life under the stern and perilous conditions;
not, however, without their fascinations,
of forest haunts, of rude and scattered cabins, of
domestic and social relations, of the resources
of the heroic whites, and of the qualities of Indian
warfare in the desperate struggle with the
invaders.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a></p>

<p>Another early writer in this field was Dr. S. P.
Hildreth of Ohio, who published his <i>Pioneer
History</i> (Cincinnati, 1848) while some of the
pioneers of the Northwest were still living, and
the papers of some of them, like Col. George
Morgan, could be put to service.<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> Dr. Hildreth,
in his <i>Biographical and Historical Memoirs of
the early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio</i> (Cincinnati,
1852), included a Memoir of Isaac Williams,
who at the age of eighteen began a course of
service and adventure in the Indian country,
which was continued till its close at the age of
eighty-four. When eighteen years of age he
was employed by the government of Pennsylvania,
being already a trained hunter, as a spy and
ranger among the Indians. He served in this
capacity in Braddock’s campaign, and was a
guard for the first convoy of provisions, on pack-horses,
to Fort Duquesne, after its surrender to
General Forbes in 1758. He was one of the
first settlers on the Muskingum, after the peace
made there with the Indians, in 1765, by Bouquet.
His subsequent life was one of daring
and heroic adventure on the frontiers.<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Passing to the more general works, the earliest
treatment of the North American Indians,
of more than local scope, was the work of
James Adair, first published in 1775, a section
of whose map, showing the position of the Indian
tribes within the present United States at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
that time, is given elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> This <i>History of
the American Indians</i> was later included by
Kingsborough in <i>Antiquities of Mexico</i> (vol. viii.
London, 1848).<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> At just about the same time
(1777), Dr. Robertson, in his <i>America</i> (book
iv.), gave a general survey, which probably represents
the level of the best European knowledge
at that time.</p>

<p>It was not till well into the present century
that much effort was made to summarize the
scattered knowledge of explorers like Lewis and
Clarke and of venturesome travellers. In 1819,
we find where we might not expect it about as
good an attempt to make a survey of the subject
as was then attainable, in Ezekiel Sanford’s
<i>History of the United States before the Revolution</i>,&mdash;a
book, however, which was pretty roundly
condemned for its general inaccuracy by Nathan
Hale in the <i>North American Review</i>. The next
year the Rev. Jedediah Morse made <i>A report to
the secretary of war, on Indian affairs, comprising
a narrative of a tour in 1820, for ascertaining
the actual state of the Indian tribes in our
country</i> (New Haven, 1822), which is about the
beginning of systematized knowledge, though
the subject in its scientific aspects was too new
for well-studied proportions. The <i>Report</i>, however,
attracted attention and instigated other
students. De Tocqueville, in 1835, took the Indian
problem within his range.<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> Albert Gallatin
printed, the next year, in the second volume
of the <i>Archæologia Americana</i> (Cambridge, 1836),
his <i>Synopsis of the Indian Tribes within the
United States east of the Rocky Mountains</i>; and
though his main purpose was to explain the linguistic
differences, his introduction is still a valuable
summary of the knowledge then existing.</p>

<p>There were at this time two well-directed
efforts in progress to catch the features and life
of the Indians as preserving their aboriginal
traits. Between 1838 and 1844 Thomas L. McKenney
and James Hall published at Philadelphia,
in three volumes folio, their <i>History of the
Indian tribes of North America, with biographical
sketches of the principal chiefs. With 120 portrs.
from the Indian gallery of the Department of war,
at Washington</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> and in 1841 the public first got
the fruits of George Catlin’s wanderings among
the Indians of the Northwest, in his <i>Letters and
notes on the manners, customs and condition of the
North American Indians, written during eight
years’ travel among the wildest tribes of Indians
in North America, in 1832-39</i> (N. Y., 1841), in
two volumes. The book went through various
editions in this country and in London.<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> It
was but the forerunner of various other books
illustrative of his experience among the tribes;
but it remains the most important.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> The sufficient
summary of all that Catlin did to elucidate
the Indian character and life will be found in
Thomas Donaldson’s <i>George Catlin’s Indian
Gallery in the U. S. Nat. Museum, with memoirs
and statistics</i>, being part v. of the <i>Smithsonian
Report</i> for 1885.<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>The great work of Schoolcraft has been elsewhere
described in the present volume.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a></p>

<p>The agencies for acquiring and disseminating
knowledge respecting the condition, past and
present, of the red race have been and are much
the same as those which improve the study of
the archæological aspects of their history: such
publications as the <i>Transactions of the American
Ethnological Society</i> (1845-1848); the <i>Reports</i>
of the governmental geological surveys,
and those upon trans-continental railway routes;
those upon national boundaries; those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Smithsonian Institution, with its larger <i>Contribution</i>s,
and of late years the <i>Reports of the
Bureau of Ethnology</i>; the reports of such institutions
as the Peabody Museum of Archæology;
and those of the Indian agents of the Federal
government, of chief importance among which
is Miss Alice C. Fletcher’s <i>Indian Education
and Civilization</i>, published by the Bureau of
Education (Washington, 1888). To these must
be added the great mass of current periodical
literature reached through <i>Poole’s Index</i>, and
the action and papers of the government, not
always easily discoverable, through Poore’s <i>Descriptive
Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p>The maps of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries are, in addition to the reports of traders,
missionaries, and adventurers, the means which
we have of placing the territories of the many
Indian tribes which, since the contact of Europeans,
have been found in North America; but
the abiding-places of the tribes have been far
from permanent. Many of these early maps are
given in other volumes of the present History.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a>
Geographers like Hutchins and military men
like Bouquet found it incumbent on them to
study this question.<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> Benjamin Smith Barton
surveyed the field in 1797; but the earliest of
special map seems to have been that compiled
by Albert Gallatin, who endeavored to place the
tribes of the Atlantic slope as they were in 1600,
and those beyond the Alleghanies as they were
in 1800. The map in the <i>American Gazetteer</i>
(London, 1762) gives some information,<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> and that
of Adair in 1775 is reproduced elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> In
1833, Catlin endeavored to give a geographical
position to all the tribes in the United States on
a map, given in his great work and reproduced in
the <i>Smithsonian Report</i>, part v. (1885). In 1840
compiled maps were given on a small scale in
George Bancroft’s third volume of his <i>United
States</i>, and another in Marryat’s <i>Travels</i>, vol. ii.
The government has from time to time published
maps showing the Indian occupation of territory,
and the present reservations are shown on maps
in Donaldson’s <i>Public Domain</i> and in the <i>Smithsonian
Report</i>, part v. (1885).<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a></p>

<p>The migrations and characteristics of the Eskimos
have already been discussed,<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> and the
journals of the Arctic explorers will yield light
upon their later conditions. We find those of
the Hudson Bay region depicted in all the books
relating to the life of the Company’s factors.<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>
The Beothuks of Newfoundland, which are
thought to have become extinct in 1828,<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> are
described in Hatton and Harvey’s <i>Newfoundland</i>;
by T. G. B. Lloyd in the <i>Journal of the
Anthropological Institute</i> (London), 1874, p. 21;
1875, p. 222; by A. S. Gatschet in the <i>American
Philosophical Society’s Transactions</i> (Philad.,
1885-86, vols. xxii. xxiii.); and in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, Dec., 1888. Leclercq in his <i>Nouvelle
Relation de la Gaspésie</i> (Paris, 1691) gives us an
account of the natives on the western side of the
gulf.<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a></p>

<p>The Micmacs of Nova Scotia are considered
in Lescarbot and the later histories and in the
documentary collections of that colony; and as
they played a part in the French wars, the range
of that military history covers some material
concerning them.<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a></p>

<p>For the aborigines of Canada, we easily revert
to the older writers, like Champlain, Sagard,
Creuxius, Boucher, Leclercq, Lafitau; the <i>Voyage
curieux et nouveau parmi les sauvages</i> of Le Beau
(Amsterdam, 1738); the <i>Nouvelle France</i> of
Charlevoix; the <i>Histoire de l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>
(Paris, 1753) of Bacqueville de la
Potherie;<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> and to the later historians, like Fernald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
(ch. 7, 8), Garneau (2d book), and Warburton’s
<i>Conquest of Canada</i> (ch. 6, 7, 8). The
Abenaki, which lay between the northeastern
settlements of the English and the French, are
specially treated by Bacqueville (vol. iv.), in the
<i>Maine Hist. Soc. Collection</i>s, vol. vi., and in Maurault’s
<i>Histoire des Abenakis</i> (1866).<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a></p>

<p>The rich descriptive literature of the early
days of New England gives us much help in understanding
the aboriginal life. We begin with
John Smith, and come down through a long
series of writers like Governor Bradford and
Edward Winslow for Plymouth; Gorges, Morton,
Winthrop, Higginson, Dudley, Johnson,
Wood, Lechford, and Roger Williams for other
parts. These are all characterized in another
place.<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> The authorities on the early wars with
the Pequots and with Philip, the accounts of

furnish the concomitants needful to the
recital. The story of the labors of Eliot, Mayhew,
and others in urging the conversion of the
natives is based upon another large range of
material, in which much that is merely exhortative
does not wholly conceal the material for the
historian.<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> Here too the chief actors in this

of Increase Mather to Leusden on the Indian
missions (1688).<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> Gookin tells us of the sufferings

<p>The principal student of the literature, mainly
religious, produced in the tongue of the natives,
has been Dr. James Hammond Trumbull, of
Hartford, and he has given us the leading accounts
of its creation and influence.<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> It was
this propagandist movement that led Eleazer
Wheelock into establishing (1754) an Indian
Charity School at Lebanon, Connecticut, which
finally removed to Hanover, in New Hampshire,
and became (1769) Dartmouth College.<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a></p>

<p>The New England tribes have produced a
considerable local illustrative literature. The
Kennebecs and Penobscots in Maine are noticed
in the histories of that State, and in many
of the local monographs.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> For New Hampshire,

are described in Wm. Little’s <i>Warren</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
(Concord, 1854), and the Pemicooks in the

Moore’s <i>Concord</i>, and Potter’s <i>Manchester</i>.</p>

<p>The Archives of Massachusetts yield a large
amount of material respecting the relations of

<p>Palfrey (<i>Hist. New England</i>, i. ch. 1, 2), in his

<p>The Iroquois of New York have probably
been the subject of a more sustained historical

Colden, and the best edition is <i>The history of the
five Indian nations depending on the province of
New-York. Reprinted exactly from Bradford’s
New York edition, 1727; with an introduction
and notes by J. G. Shea</i> (New York, 1866).<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> The
London reprints of 1747, and later, unfortunately
added to the title <i>Five Indian Nations</i> [<i>of
Canada</i>] the words in brackets. This was the
very point denied by the English, who claimed
that the French had no territorial rights south
of the lakes. Otherwise his title conveys two
significant facts: first, that the English had
come to regard the Five Nations as their “dependants”;
and second, that these Indians actually
were a barrier between them and the
French. There was something farcical in the
formula used by Sir Wm. Johnson in a letter
to the ministry: “The combined tribes have
taken arms against his Britannic Majesty.” The
Mohawks had been induced to ask that the
Duke of York’s arms should be attached to
their castles. This had been assented to, and
allowed as a security against the inroads of the
French&mdash;a sort of talismanic charm which might
be respected by European usage. But those
ducal bearings did not have their full meaning
to the Iroquois as binding their own allegiance,
nor were the Six Nations ever the gainers by
being thus constructively protected.</p>

<p>Colden was born in Scotland in 1688, and
died on Long Island in 1776. He was a physician,
botanist, scholar, and literary man, able
and well qualified in each pursuit. The greater
part of his long life was spent in this country.
As councillor, lieutenant-governor, and acting
governor, he was in the administration of New
York from 1720 till near his death. He was a
most inquisitive and intelligent investigator and
observer of Indian history and character. In
dedicating his work to General Oglethorpe, he
claims to have been prompted to it by his interest
in the welfare of the Five Nations. He is
frank and positive in expressing his judgment
that they had been degraded and demoralized
by their intercourse with the whites. He says
that he wrote the former part of his history in
New York, in 1727, to thwart the manœuvres
of the French in their efforts to monopolize
the western fur trade. They had been allowed
to import woollen goods for the Indian traffic
through New York. Governor Burnet advised
that a stop be put to this abuse. The New
York legislature furthered his advice, and built
a fort at Oswego for three hundred traders.
When the Duke of York was represented here
by Governor Dongan, and “Popish interests”
were allowed sway,&mdash;there being at the time a
mean pretence of amity between England and
France,&mdash;the interests of the former were sacrificed
to those of the latter. This, of course, had
a bad influence on the Five Nations, as leading
them to regard the French as masters. The
whole of the first part of Colden’s History deals
with the Iroquois as merely the centre of the
rivalry between the French and the English
with their respective savage allies. The English
had the advantage at the start, because
from the earliest period when Champlain made
a hostile incursion into the country of the Iroquois,
attended by their Huron enemies, the relations
of enmity were decided upon, and afterwards
were constantly imbittered by a series of
invasions. The French sought to undo their
own influence of this sort when it became necessary
for them to try to win over the Iroquois to
their own interest in the fur traffic. The Confederacy
which existed among the Five, and
afterwards the Six, Nations was roughly tried
when there was so sharp a bidding for alliances
between one or another of the tribes by their
European tempters. An incidental and very
embarrassing element came in to complicate the
relations of the parties, English, French, and Indians,
on the grounds of the claim advanced by
the English to hold the region beyond the Alleghanies
by cession from the Iroquois in a council
in 1726. The question was whether the Iroquois
had previous to that time obtained tenable
possession of the Ohio region, by conquest of
the former occupants. It would appear that
after that conquest that region was for a time
well-nigh deserted. When it was to some extent
reoccupied, the subsequent hunters and tenants
of it denied the sovereignty of the Iroquois
and the rights of the English intruders who relied
upon the old treaty of cession.</p>

<p>The rival French history while Colden was in
vogue was the third volume of Bacqueville de
la Potherie’s <i>Hist. de l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>
(Paris, 1753); and another contemporary English
view appeared in Wm. Smith’s <i>Hist. of the
Province of New York</i> (1757).<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> Nothing appeared
after this of much moment as a general
account of the Six Nations till Henry R. Schoolcraft
made his <i>Report</i> to the New York authorities
in 1845, which was published in a more
popular form in his <i>Notes on the Iroquois, or
Contributions to American history, antiquities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and general ethnology</i> (Albany, 1847), a book not
valued overmuch.<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a></p>

<p>Better work was done by J. V. H. Clark in
what is in effect a good history of the Confederacy,
in his <i>Onondaga</i> (Syracuse, 1849). The
series of biographies by W. L. Stone, of Sir
William Johnson, Brant, and Red Jacket, form
a continuous history for a century (1735-1838).<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>
The most carefully studied work of all has been
that of Lewis H. Morgan in his <i>League of the
Iroquois</i> (1851), a book of which Parkman says
(<i>Jesuits</i>, p. liv) that it commands a place far in
advance of all others, and he adds, “Though
often differing widely from Mr. Morgan’s conclusions,
I cannot bear too emphatic testimony to the
value of his researches.”<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> The latest scholarly
treatment of the Iroquois history is by Horatio
Hale in the introduction to <i>The Iroquois Book of

Brinton, in <i>The National Legend of the

he derived from a German version preserved in

G. Gale’s <i>Upper Mississippi</i> (Chicago, 1867) gives

for all this territory. Use can be also made of
Caleb Atwater’s <i>Indians of the Northwest, or a
Tour to Prairie du Chien</i> (Columbus, 1850). Dr.
John G. Shea and others have used the <i>Collections

One of the most readable studies of the Indians
in the neighborhood of Lake Superior is John
G. Kohl’s <i>Kitchi-Gami</i> (1860). The authorities

Siouan Languages</i> (1887) affords the readiest key
to the mass of books about the Sioux or Dacotah
stocks from the time of Hennepin and the
early adventurers in the Missouri Valley. The
travellers Carver and Catlin are of importance
here. Mrs. Eastman’s <i>Dacotah, or life and legends
of the Sioux</i> (1849) is an excellent book that has
not yet lost its value; and the same can be said
of Francis Parkman’s <i>California and the Oregon
Trail</i> (N. Y., 1849), which shows that historian’s
earliest experience of the wild camp life.
Miss Alice C. Fletcher is the latest investigator

the Omaha sociology in the <i>Third Rept. Bureau

some account in the <i>Transactions</i> (vol. i.) of the
Nebraska State Hist. Society, and a tract by
Miss Fletcher on the <i>Omaha tribe of Indians in
Nebraska</i> (Washington, 1885). The Pawnees
have been described by J. B. Dunbar in the <i>Mag.
Amer. Hist.</i> (vols. iv., v., viii., ix.) The Ojibways
have had two native historians,&mdash;Geo. Copway’s
<i>Traditional Hist. of the Ojibway Nation</i> (London,
1850), and Peter Jones’ <i>Hist. of the Ojibway Indians,
with special reference to their conversion to
Christianity</i> (London, 1861). The <i>Minnesota
Hist. Soc. Collections</i> (vol. v.) contain other historical
accounts by Wm. W. Warren and by
Edw. D. Neill,&mdash;the latter touching their connection
with the fur-traders. Miss Fletcher’s
<i>Report</i> (1888) will supplement all these accounts
of the aborigines of this region.</p>

<p>Our best knowledge of the southwestern Indians,
the Apaches, Navajos, Utes, Comanches,
and the rest, comes from such government observers
as Emory in his <i>Military Reconnaissance</i>;
Marcy’s <i>Exploration of the Red River in 1852</i>;
J. H. Simpson in his <i>Expedition into the Navajo
Country</i> (1856); and E. H. Ruffner’s <i>Reconnoissance
in the Ute Country</i> (1874). The fullest

with a map.</p>

<p>We may still find in Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i>
(i. ch. 2, 3) the best summarized statement with
references on the tribes of the upper Pacific
coast, and follow the development of our knowledge
in the narratives of the early explorers of
that coast by water, in the account of Lewis and
Clark and other overland travels, and in such
tales of adventures as the <i>Journal kept at Nootka
Sound by John R. Jewitt</i>, which has had various

the Federal government have published several

<p class="pch">THE PREHISTORIC ARCHÆOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICA.</p>

<p class="pc">BY HENRY W. HAYNES,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Archæological Institute of America.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap08">BY the discovery of America a new continent was brought to light, inhabited
by many distinct tribes, differing in language and in customs,
but strikingly alike in physical appearance. All that can be learned in
regard to their condition, and that of their ancestors, prior to the coming of
Columbus, falls within the domain of the prehistoric archæology of America.
This recent science of Prehistoric Archæology deals mainly with
facts, not surmises. In studying the past of forgotten races, “hid from
the world in the low-delved tomb,” her chief agent is the spade, not the
pen. Her leading principles, the lamps by which her path is guided, are
superposition, association, and style. Does this new science teach us that
the tribes found in possession of the soil were the descendants of its original
occupants, or does she rather furnish reasons for inferring that these
had been preceded by some extinct race or races? The first question,
therefore, that presents itself to us relates to the antiquity of man upon
this continent; and in respect to this the progress of archæological investigation
has brought about a marked change of opinion. Modern speculation,
based upon recent discoveries, inclines to favor the view that this
continent was inhabited at least as early as in the later portion of the
quaternary or pleistocene period. Whether this primitive people was autochthonous
or not, is a problem that probably will never be solved; but it
is now generally held that this earliest population was intruded upon by
other races, coming either from Asia or from the Pacific Islands, from whom
were descended the various tribes which have occupied the soil down to the
present time.</p>

<p>The writer believes also that the majority of American archæologists
now sees no sufficient reason for supposing that any mysterious, superior
race has ever lived in any portion of our continent. They find no archæological
evidence proving that at the time of its discovery any tribe had
reached a stage of culture that can properly be called civilization. Even if
we accept the exaggerated statements of the Spanish conquerors, the most
intelligent and advanced peoples found here were only semi-barbarians, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the stage of transition from the stone to the bronze age, possessing no written
language, or what can properly be styled an alphabet, and not yet having
even learned the use of beasts of burden.</p>

<p>By a large and growing school of archæologists, moreover, it is maintained
that all the various tribes upon this continent, notwithstanding their
different degrees of advancement, were living under substantially similar
institutions; and that even the different forms of house construction practised
by them were only stages in the development of the same general
conceptions. Without attempting to dogmatize about such difficult problems,
the object of this chapter is to set forth concisely such views as
recommend themselves to the writer’s judgment. He is profoundly conscious
of the limitations of his knowledge, and fully aware that his opinions
will be at variance with those of other competent and learned investigators.
<i>Non nostrum tantas componere lites.</i></p>

<p>The controversy in regard to the antiquity of man in the old world may
be regarded as substantially settled. Scarcely any one now denies that
man was in existence there during the close of the quaternary or pleistocene
period; but there is a great difference of opinion as to the sufficiency
of the evidence thus far brought forward to prove that he had made his
appearance in Europe in the previous tertiary period, or even in the earlier
part of the quaternary. What is the present state of opinion in regard to
the correlative question about the antiquity of man in America? Less than
ten years ago the latest treatise published in this country, in which this
subject came under discussion, met the question with the sweeping reply
that “no truly scientific proof of man’s great antiquity in America exists.”<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>
But we think if the author of that thorough and “truly scientific” work
were living now his belief would be different. After a careful consideration
of all the former evidence that had been adduced in proof of man’s
early existence upon this continent, none of which seemed to him conclusive,
he goes on to state that “Dr. C. C. Abbott has unquestionably discovered
many palæolithic implements in the glacial drift in the valley of the
Delaware River, near Trenton, New Jersey.”<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> Now a single discovery of
this character, if it were unquestionable, or incapable of any other explanation,
would be sufficient to prove that man existed upon this continent in
quaternary times. The establishment, therefore, of the antiquity of man
in America, according to this latest authority, seems to rest mainly upon
the fact of the discovery by Dr. Abbott of palæolithic implements in the
valley of the Delaware. To quote the language of an eminent European
man of science, “This gentleman appears to stand in a somewhat similar
relation to this great question in America as did Boucher de Perthes in
Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> The opinion of the majority of American geologists upon this
point is clearly indicated in a very recent article by Mr. W. J. McGee, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the U. S. Geological Survey: “But it is in the aqueo-glacial gravels of the
Delaware River, at Trenton, which were laid down contemporaneously
with the terminal moraine one hundred miles further northward, and which
have been so thoroughly studied by Abbott, that the most conclusive proof
of the existence of glacial man is found.”<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> It will accordingly be necessary
to give in considerable detail an account of the discovery of palæolithic implements
by Dr. Abbott in the Delaware valley, and of its confirmation by
different investigators, as well as of such other discoveries in different parts
of our country as tend to substantiate the conclusions that have been drawn
from them by archæologists.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By the term palæolithic implements we are to understand certain rude
stone objects, of varying size, roughly fashioned into shape by a process of
chipping away fragments from a larger mass so as to produce cutting edges,
with convex sides, massive, and suited to be held at one end, and usually
pointed at the other. These have never afterwards been subjected to any
smoothing or polishing process by rubbing them against another stone.
But it is only when such rude tools have been found buried in beds of
gravel or other deposits, which have been laid down by great floods towards
the close of what is known to geologists as the quaternary or pleistocene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
period, that they can be regarded as really palæolithic.<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> At that epoch
which immediately preceded the present period, certain rivers flowed with a
volume of water much greater than now, owing to the melting of the thick
ice-cap once covering large portions of the northern hemisphere, which was
accompanied by a climate of great humidity. Vast quantities of gravels
were washed down from the débris of the great terminal moraine of this
ice-sheet, and were accumulated in beds of great thickness, extending in
some instances as high as two hundred feet up the slopes of the river valleys.
In such deposits, side by side with the rude products of human industry
we have thus described, and deposited by the same natural forces,
are found the fossil remains of several species of animals, which have
subsequently either become extinct, like the mammoth and the tichorhine
rhinoceros, or, driven southwards by the encroaching ice, have since its
disappearance migrated to arctic regions, like the musk-sheep and the reindeer,
or to the higher Alpine slopes, like the marmot. Such a discovery
establishes the fact that man must have been living as the contemporary of
these extinct animals, and this is the only proof of his antiquity that is at
present universally accepted.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion among geologists in regard to both
the duration and the conditions of the glacial period, but it is now the
settled opinion that there have been two distinct times of glacial action,
separated by a long interval of warmer climate, as is proved by the occurrence
of intercalated fossiliferous beds; this was followed by the final
retreat of the glacier.<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> The great terminal moraine stretching across the
United States from Cape Cod to Dakota, and thence northward to the
foot of the Rocky Mountains, marks the limit of the ice invasion in the
second glacial epoch. South of this, extending in its farthest boundary
as low as the 38th degree of latitude, is a deposit which thins out as we go
west and northwest, and which is called the drift-area. The drift graduates
into a peculiar mud deposit, for which the name of “loess” has been
adopted from the geologists of Europe, by whom it was given to a thick
alluvial stratum of fine sand and loam, of glacial origin. This attenuated
drift represents the first glacial invasion. From Massachusetts as far as
northern New Jersey, and in some other places, the deposits of the two
epochs seem to coalesce.<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>The interval of time that separated the two glacial periods can be best
imagined by considering the great erosions that have taken place in the
valleys of the Missouri and of the upper Ohio. “Glacial river deposits of
the earlier epoch form the capping of fragmentary terraces that stand 250
to 300 feet above the present rivers;” while those of the second epoch
stretch down through a trough excavated to that depth by the river through
these earlier deposits and the rock below.<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a></p>

<p>As to the probable time that has elapsed since the close of the glacial
period, the tendency of recent speculation is to restrict the vast extent that
was at first suggested for it to a period of from twenty thousand to thirty
thousand years. The most conservative view maintains that it need not
have been more than ten thousand years, or even less.<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> This lowest
estimate, however, can only be regarded as fixing a minimum point, and an
antiquity vastly greater than this must be assigned to man, as of necessity
he must have been in existence long before the final events occurred in
order to have left his implements buried in the beds of débris which they
occasioned.</p>

<p>In April, 1873, Dr. C. C. Abbott, who was already well known as an
investigator of the antiquities of the Indian races, which he believed had
passed from “a palæolithic to a neolithic condition” while occupying the
Atlantic seaboard, published an article on the “Occurrence of implements in
the river-drift at Trenton, New Jersey.”<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> In this he described and figured
three rude implements, which he had found buried at a depth as great in one
instance as sixteen feet in the gravels of a bluff overlooking the Delaware
River. He argued that these must be of greater antiquity than relics
found on the surface, from the fact of their occurring <i>in place</i> in undisturbed
deposits; that they could not have reached such a depth by any natural
means; and that they must be of human origin, and not accidental formations,
because as many as three had been discovered of a like character.
His conclusion is that they are “true drift implements, fashioned and
used by a people far antedating the people who subsequently occupied this
same territory.”</p>

<p>After two years of further research he returned to the subject, publishing
in the same journal, in June, 1876, an account of the discovery of seven
similar objects near the same locality. Of these he said: “My studies of
these palæolithic specimens and of their positions in the gravel-beds and
overlying soil have led me to conclude that not long after the close of the
last glacial epoch man appeared in the valley of the Delaware.”<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a></p>

<p>Most of these specimens were deposited by Dr. Abbott in the Peabody
Museum of American Archæology and Ethnology at Cambridge, Massachusetts;
and the curator of that institution, Professor Frederick W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Putnam, in September, 1876, visited the locality in company with Dr.
Abbott. Together they succeeded in finding two examples <i>in place</i>.
Having been commissioned to continue his investigations, Dr. Abbott
presented to the trustees, in November of the same year, a detailed report
<i>On the Discovery of Supposed Palæolithic Implements from the Glacial
Drift in the Valley of the Delaware River, near Trenton, New Jersey</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>
In this, three of the most characteristic specimens were figured, which had
been submitted to Mr. M. E. Wadsworth of Cambridge, to determine their
lithological character. He pronounced them to be made of argillite, and
declared that the chipping upon them could not be attributed to any
natural cause, and that the weathering of their surfaces indicated their very
great antiquity. The question “how and when these implements came to
be in the gravel” is discussed by Dr. Abbott at some length. He argued
that the same forces which spread the beds of gravel over the wide area
now covered carried them also; and he predicted that they will be met with
wherever such gravels occur in other parts of the State. He specially dwells
upon the circumstances that the implements were found in <i>undisturbed</i>
portions of the freshly exposed surface of the bluff, and not in the mass of
talus accumulated at its base, into which they might have fallen from the
surface; and that they have been found at great depths, “varying from five
to over twenty feet below the overlying soil.” He also insisted upon the
marked difference between their appearance and the materials of which
they are fashioned and the customary relics of the Indians. The conditions
under which the gravel-beds were accumulated are then studied in connection
with a report upon them by Professor N. S. Shaler, which concludes,
from the absence of stratification and of pebbles marked with glacial
scratches, that they were “formed in the sea near the foot of the retreating
ice-sheet, when the sub-glacial rivers were pouring out the vast quantities
of water and waste that clearly were released during the breaking up of the
great ice-time.” This view regards the deposits as of glacial origin, and as
laid down during that period, but considers that they were subsequently
modified in their arrangement by the action of water. In such gravel-beds
there have also been found rolled fragments of reindeer-horns, and skulls of
the walrus, as well as the relics of man. Dr. Abbott accordingly drew the
conclusion that “man dwelt at the foot of the glacier, or at least wandered
over the open sea, during the accumulation of this mass of gravel;” that
he was contemporary of these arctic animals; and that this early race was
driven southward by the encroaching ice, leaving its rude implements
behind. Thus it will be seen that Dr. Abbott no longer considers man in
this country as belonging to post-glacial, but to interglacial times.</p>

<p>Continuing his investigations, in the following year Dr. Abbott gave a
much more elaborate account of his work and its results, in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
announced his discovery of some sixty additional specimens.<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> To the
objection that had been raised, that these supposed implements might have
been produced by the action of frost, he replied that a single fractured
surface might have originated in that way or from an accidental blow; but
when we find upon the same object from twenty to forty planes of cleavage,
all equally weathered (which shows that the fragments were all detached
at or about the same time), it is impossible not to recognize in this the
result of intentional action. Four such implements are described and
figured, of shapes much more specialized than those previously published,
and resembling very closely objects which European archæologists style
stone axes of “the Chellean type,” whose artificial origin cannot be
doubted.</p>

         <p class="pf400">From a photograph kindly furnished by Professor F. W. Putnam, showing the Delaware and its bluff of
gravel, where many of the rude implements have been found.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As some geologists were still inclined to insist upon the post-glacial
character of the débris in which the implements were found, Dr. Abbott,
admitting that the great terminal moraine of the northern ice-sheet does
not approach nearer than forty miles to the bluff at Trenton, nevertheless
insists that the character of the deposits there much more resembles a
mass of material accumulated in the sea at the foot of the glacier than it
does beds that have been subjected to the modifying arrangement of
water. He finds an explanation of this condition of things in a prolongation
of the glacier down the valley of the Delaware as far as Trenton, at a
time when the lower portions of the State had suffered a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
depression, and before the retreat of the ice-sheet. But besides the
comparatively unmodified material of the bluff, in which the greater portion
of the palæolithic implements has been found, there also occur limited
areas of stratified drift, such as are to be seen in railway cuttings near
Trenton, in which similar implements are also occasionally found. These,
however, present a more worn appearance than the others. But it will be
found that these tracts of clearly stratified material are so very limited
in extent that they seem to imply some peculiar local condition of the
glacier. This position is illustrated by certain remarkable effects once
witnessed after a very severe rainfall, by which two palæolithic implements
were brought into immediate contact with ordinary Indian relics such as
are common on the surface. This leads to an examination of the question
of the origin of this surface soil, and a discussion of the problem how true
palæolithic implements sometimes occur in it. This soil is known to be a
purely sedimentary deposit, consisting almost exclusively of sand, or of
such finely comminuted gravels as would readily be transported by rapid
currents of water. But imbedded in it and making a part of it are numerous
huge boulders, too heavy to be moved by water. Dr. Abbott accounted
for their presence from their having been dropped by ice-rafts, while the
process of deposition of the soil was going on. The same sort of agency
could not have put in place both the soil and the boulders contained in it,
and the same force which transported the latter may equally well have
brought along such implements as occur in the beds of clearly stratified
origin. The wearing effect upon these of gravels swept along by post-glacial
floods will account for that worn appearance which sometimes
almost disguises their artificial origin.</p>

<p>In conclusion Dr. Abbott attempted to determine what was the early
race which preceded the Indians in the occupation of this continent.
From the peculiar nature and qualities of palæolithic implements he argues
that they are adapted to the needs of a people “living in a country of
vastly different character, and with a different fauna,” from the densely
wooded regions of the Atlantic seaboard, where the red man found his
home. The physical conditions of the glacial times much more nearly resembled
those now prevailing in the extreme north. Accordingly he finds
the descendants of the early race in the Eskimos of North America, driven
northwards after contact with the invading Indian race. In this he is following
the opinion of Professor William Boyd Dawkins, who considers that
people to be of the same blood as the palæolithic cave-dwellers of southern
France, and that of Mr. Dall and Dr. Rink, who believed that they once
occupied this continent as far south as New Jersey. In confirmation of
this view he asserts that the Eskimos “until recently used stone implements
of the rudest patterns.” But unfortunately for this theory the implements
of the Eskimos bear no greater resemblance to palæolithic
implements than do those of any other people in the later stone age; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
subsequent discoveries of human crania in the Trenton gravels have led
Dr. Abbott to question its soundness.<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a></p>

<p>These discoveries of Dr. Abbott are not liable to the imputation of possible
errors of observation or record, as would be the case if they rested
upon the testimony of a single person only. As has been already stated,
in September, 1876, Professor Putnam was present at the finding <i>in place</i>
of two palæolithic implements, and in all has taken five with his own hands
from the gravel at various depths.<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> Mr. Lucien Carr also visited the locality
in company with Professor J. D. Whitney, in September, 1878, and found
several <i>in place</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> Since then Professors Shaler, Dawkins, Wright, Lewis,
and others, including the writer, have all succeeded in finding specimens
either in place or in the talus along the face of the bluff, from which they
had washed out from freshly exposed surfaces of the gravel.<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> The whole
number thus far discovered by Dr. Abbott amounts to about four hundred
specimens.<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> Meanwhile, the problem of the conditions under which the
Trenton gravels had been accumulated was made the subject of careful
study by other competent geologists, besides Professor Shaler, to whose
opinion reference has already been made. In October, 1877, the late
Thomas Belt, F. G. S., visited the locality, and shortly afterwards published
an account of Dr. Abbott’s discoveries, illustrated by several geological
sections of the gravel. His conclusion is, “that after the land-ice
retired, or whilst it was retiring, and before the coast was submerged to
such a depth as to permit the flotation of icebergs from the north, the
upper pebble-beds containing the stone implements were formed.”<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> The
geologists of the New Jersey Survey had already recognized the distinction
between the drift gravels of Trenton and the earlier yellow marine gravels
which cover the lower part of the State. But it was the late Professor
Henry Carvill Lewis, of Philadelphia, who first accurately described the
character and limits of the Trenton gravels.<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> This he had carefully
mapped before he was informed of Dr. Abbott’s discoveries, and it has
been found (with only one possible very recent exception) that the implements
occur solely in these newer gravels of the glacial period.</p>

<p>Professor Lewis’s matured conclusions in regard to the geological character
and the age of the Trenton gravel cliff are thus expressed: “The presence
of large boulders in the bluff at Trenton, and the extent and depth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
gravel at this place, have led to the supposition that there was here the
extremity of a glacial moraine. Yet the absence of ‘till’ and of scratched
boulders, the absence of glacial striæ upon the rocks of the valley, and
the stratified character of the gravel, all point to water action alone as
the agent of deposition. The depth of the gravel and the presence of the
bluff at this point are explained by the peculiar position that Trenton occupies
relatively to the river, ... in a position where naturally the largest
amount of a river gravel would be deposited, and where its best exposures
would be exhibited.... Any drift material which the flooded river swept
down its channel would here, upon meeting tide-water, be in great part
deposited. Boulders which had been rolled down the inclined floor of the
upper valley would here stop in their course, and all be heaped up with the
coarser gravel in the more slowly flowing water, except such as cakes of
floating ice could carry oceanward.... Having heaped up a mass of detritus
in the old river channel as an obstruction at the mouth of the gorge,
the river, so soon as its volume diminished, would immediately begin wearing
away a new channel for itself down to ocean level. This would be
readily accomplished through the loose material, and would be stopped only
when rock was reached.... It has been thought that to account for the
high bank at Trenton an elevation of the land must have occurred....
An increase in the volume of the river will explain all the facts. The

<p>“The Trenton gravel, now confined to the sandy flat borders of the river,
corresponds to the ‘intervale’ of New England rivers, ... and exhibits
a topography peculiar to a true river gravel. Frequently instead of forming
a flat plain it forms higher ground close to the present river channel
than it does near its ancient bank. Moreover, not only does the ground
thus slope downward on retreating from the river, but the boulders become
smaller and less abundant. Both of these facts are in accordance with the
facts of river deposits. In time of flood the rapidly flowing water in the
main channel, bearing detritus, is checked by the more quiet waters at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the side of the river, and is forced to deposit its gravel and boulders as a
kind of bank.... Having shown that the Trenton gravel is a true river
gravel of comparatively recent age, it remains to point out the relation it
bears to the glacial epoch.... Two hypotheses only can be applied to the
Trenton gravel. It is either <i>post</i>-glacial, or it belongs to the very last portion
of the glacial period. The view held by the late Thomas Belt can no
longer be maintained.... He fails to recognize any distinction between
the gravels. As we have seen, the Trenton gravel is truly post-glacial. It
only remains to define more strictly the meaning of that term. There is
evidence to support both of these hypotheses.”<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p>After discussing them both at considerable length, he concludes as follows:
“A second glacial period in Europe, known as the ‘Reindeer Period,’
has long been recognized. It appears to have followed that in which the
clays were deposited and the terraces formed, and may therefore correspond
with the period of the Trenton gravel. If there have been two glacial
epochs in this country, the Trenton gravel cannot be earlier than the close
of the later one. If there has been but one, traces of the glacier must
have continued into comparatively recent times, or long after the period of
submergence. The Trenton gravel, whether made by long-continued floods
which followed a first or second glacial epoch,&mdash;whether separated from all
true glacial action or the result of the glacier’s final melting,&mdash;is truly a
post-glacial deposit, but still a phenomenon of essentially glacial times,&mdash;times
more nearly related to the Great Ice Age than to the present.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to consider the bearings of the age of this gravel upon
the question of the antiquity of man. “When we find that the Trenton
gravel contains implements of human workmanship so placed with reference
to it that it is evident that at or soon after the time of its deposition
man had appeared on its borders, and when the question of the antiquity
of man in America is thus before us, we are tempted to inquire still further
into the age of the deposit under discussion. It has been clearly shown
by several competent archæologists that the implements that have been
found are a constituent part of the gravel, and not intrusive objects. It
was of peculiar interest to find that it has been only within the limits of
the Trenton gravel, precisely traced out by the writer, that Dr. Abbott,
Professor F. W. Putnam, Mr. Lucien Carr, and others, have discovered
these implements <i>in situ</i>.... At the localities on the Pennsylvania Railroad,
where extensive exposures of these gravels have been made, the deposit
is undoubtedly undisturbed. No implements could have come into
this gravel except at a time when the river flowed upon it, and when they
might have sunk through the loose and shifting material. All the evidence
points to the conclusion that at the time of the Trenton gravel flood man
... lived upon the banks of the ancient Delaware, and lost his stone implements
in the shifting sands and gravel of the bed of that stream....
The actual age of the Trenton gravel, and the consequent date to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the antiquity of man on the Delaware should be assigned, is a question
which geological data alone are insufficient to solve. The only clew, and
that a most unsatisfactory one, is afforded by calculations based upon the
amount of erosion. This, like all geological considerations, is relative
rather than absolute, yet several calculations have been made, which, based
either upon the rate of erosion of river channels or the rate of accumulation
of sediment, have attempted to fix the date of the close of the glacial
epoch. By assuming that the Trenton gravel was deposited immediately
after the close of this epoch, an account of such calculations may be of
interest. If the Trenton gravel is <i>post</i>-glacial in the widest acceptation of
the term, a yet later date must be assigned to it.”</p>

<p>After going carefully through them all, he concludes: “Thus we find
that if any reliance is to be placed upon such calculations, even if we
assume that the Trenton gravel is of glacial age, it is not necessary to
make it more than ten thousand years old. The time necessary for the
Delaware to cut through the gravel down to the rock is by no means great.
When it is noted that the gravel cliff at Trenton was made by a side wearing
away at a bank, and when it is remembered that the erosive power of
the Delaware River was formerly greater than at present, it will be conceded
that the presence of the cliff at Trenton will not necessarily infer its high
antiquity; nor in the character of the gravel is there any evidence that the
time of its deposition need have been long. It may be that, as investigations
are carried further, it will result not so much in proving man of very
great antiquity as in showing how much more recent than usually supposed
was the final disappearance of the glacier.”</p>

<p>Professor Lewis’s studies of the great terminal moraine of the northern
ice-sheet were still further prosecuted in conjunction with Professor George
Frederick Wright, of Oberlin, Ohio, whose labors have been of the highest
importance in shedding light upon the question of the antiquity of man in
America.<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> Together they traced the southern boundary of the glacial region
across the State of Pennsylvania, and subsequently Professor Wright
has continued his researches through the States of Ohio, Indiana, and
Kentucky, as far as the Mississippi River and even beyond. He has found
that glacial floods similar to those of the Delaware valley have deposited
similar beds of drift gravel in the valleys of all the southerly flowing rivers,
and he has called attention to the importance of searching in them for
palæolithic implements. As early as March, 1883, he predicted that traces
of early man would be found in the extensive terraces and gravel deposits
of the southern portion of Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> This prediction was speedily fulfilled,
and upon November 4, 1885, Professor Putnam reported to the Boston
Society of Natural History that Dr. C. L. Metz, of Madisonville, Ohio, had
found in the gravels of the valley of the Little Miami River, at that place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
eight feet below the surface, a rude implement made of black flint, of about
the same size and shape as one of the same material found by Dr. Abbott
in the Trenton gravels. This was followed by the announcement from Dr.
Metz that he had discovered another specimen (a chipped pebble) in the
gravels at Loveland, in the same valley, at a depth of nearly thirty feet
from the surface. Professor Wright has visited both localities, and given
a detailed description of them, illustrated by a map. He finds that the
deposit at Madisonville clearly belongs to the glacial-terrace epoch, and is
underlain by “till,” while in that at Loveland it is known that the bones
of the mastodon have been discovered. He closes his account with these
words: “In the light of the exposition just given, these implements will
at once be recognized as among the most important archæological discoveries
yet made in America, ranking on a par with those of Dr. Abbott at
Trenton, New Jersey. They show that in Ohio, as well as on the Atlantic
coast, man was an inhabitant before the close of the glacial period.”<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a>
Further confirmation of these predictions was received at the meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Cleveland,
Ohio, in August, 1888, when Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson reported his discovery
of a large flint implement in the glacial gravels of Jackson County,
Indiana, as well as of two chipped implements made of argillite, which he
had found <i>in place</i> at a depth of several feet in the ancient terrace of the
Delaware River, in Claymont, Newcastle County, Delaware.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p>This discovery of Mr. Cresson’s has assumed a great geological importance,
and it is thus reported by him: “Toward midday of July 13, 1887,
while lying upon the edge of the railroad cut, sketching the boulder line,
my eye chanced to notice a piece of steel-gray substance, strongly relieved
in the sunlight against the red-colored gravel, just above where it joined
the lower grayish-red portion. It seemed to me like argillite, and being
firmly imbedded in the gravel was decidedly interesting. Descending the
steep bank as rapidly as possible, the specimen was secured.... Upon
examining my specimen I found that it was unquestionably a chipped implement.
There is no doubt about its being firmly imbedded in the gravel, for
the delay I made in extricating it with my pocket-knife nearly caused me
the unpleasant position of being covered by several tons of gravel....
Having duly reported my find to Professor Putnam, I began, at his request,
a thorough examination of the locality, and on May 25, 1888, the year
following, discovered another implement four feet below the surface, at a
place about one eighth of a mile from the first discovery.... The geological
formation in which the implement was found seems to be a reddish
gravel mixed with schist.”<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a></p>

<p>Professor Wright thus comments upon these discoveries and their geological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
situation: “The discovery of palæolithic implements, as described
by Mr. Cresson, near Claymont, Del., unfolds a new chapter in the history
of man in America. It was my privilege in November last to visit the spot
with him, and to spend a day examining the various features of the locality....
The cut in the Baltimore and Ohio railroad in which this implement
was found is about one mile and a half west of the Delaware River, and
about one hundred and fifty feet above it. The river is here quite broad.
Indeed, it has ceased to be a river, and is already merging into Delaware
Bay; the New Jersey shore being about three miles distant from the Delaware
side. The ascent from the bay at Claymont to the locality under consideration
is by three or four well-marked benches. These probably are
not terraces in the strict sense of the word, but shelves marking different
periods of erosion when the land stood at these several levels, but now
thinly covered with old river deposits. Upon reaching the locality of Mr.
Cresson’s recent discovery, we find a well-marked superficial water deposit
containing pebbles and small boulders up to two or three feet in diameter,
and resting unconformably upon other deposits, different in character, and
in some places directly upon the decomposed schists which characterize the
locality. This is without question the Philadelphia Red Gravel and Brick
Clay of Lewis. The implement submitted to us was found near the bottom
of this upper deposit, and eight feet below the surface.... As Mr.
Cresson was on the ground when the implement was uncovered, and took
it out with his own hands, there would seem to be no reasonable doubt that
it was originally a part of the deposit; for Mr. Cresson is no novice in these
matters, but has had unusual opportunities, both in this country and in the
old world, to study the localities where similar discoveries have heretofore
been made. The absorbing question concerning the age of this deposit is
therefore forced upon our attention as archæologists.... The determination
of the age of these particular deposits at Claymont involves a discussion
of the whole question of the Ice Age in North America, and especially
that of the duality of the glacial epoch. At a meeting of this society
on January 19, 1881, I discussed the age of the Trenton gravel, in which
Dr. Abbott has found so many palæoliths, and was led also incidentally at
the same time to discuss the relative age of what Professor Lewis called the
Philadelphia Red Gravel. I had at that time recently made repeated trips
to Trenton, and with Professor Lewis had been over considerable portions of
the Delaware valley for the express purpose of determining these questions.
The conclusions to which we&mdash;that is, Professor Lewis and myself&mdash;came
were thus expressed in the paper above referred to (<i>Proc. Boston Soc. of
Nat. Hist.</i>, vol. xxi. pp. 137-145), namely, that the Philadelphia Brick Clay
and Red Gravel (which are essentially one formation) marked the period
when the ice had its greatest extension, and when there was a considerable
depression of the land in that vicinity; perhaps, however, less than a hundred
feet in the neighborhood of the moraine, though increasing towards
the northwest. During this period of greatest extension and depression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the Philadelphia Red Gravel and Brick Clay were deposited by the ice-laden
floods which annually poured down the valley in the summer seasons. As
the ice retreated towards the headwaters of the valley, the period was
marked also by a reëlevation of the land to about its present height, when
the later deposits of gravel at Trenton took place. Dr. Abbott’s discoveries
at Trenton prove the presence of man on the continent at that
stage of the glacial epoch. Mr. Cresson’s discoveries prove the presence
of man at a far earlier stage. How much earlier, will depend upon our interpretation
of the general facts bearing on the question of the duality of
the glacial epoch.</p>

<p>“Mr. McGee, of the United States Geological Survey, has recently published
the results of extensive investigations carried on by him respecting
the superficial deposits of the Atlantic coast. (See <i>Amer. Jour. of Science</i>,
vol. xxxv., 1888.) He finds that on all the rivers south of the Delaware
there are deposits corresponding in character to what Professor Lewis had
denominated Philadelphia Red Gravel and Brick Clay.... From the extent
to which this deposit is developed at Washington, in the District of
Columbia, Mr. McGee prefers to designate it the Columbia formation. But
the period is regarded by him as identical with that of the Philadelphia Red
Gravel and Brick Clay, which Professor Lewis had attributed to the period
of maximum glacial development on the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>“It is observable that the boulders in this Columbia formation belong, so
far as we know, in every case, to the valleys in which they are now found....
It is observable also that it is not necessary in any case to suppose
that these deposits were the direct result of glacial ice. Mr. McGee does
not suppose that glaciers extended down these valleys to any great distance.
Indeed, so far as we are aware, there is no evidence of even local glaciers
in the Alleghany Mountains south of Harrisburg. But it is easy to see
that an incidental result of the glacial period was a great increase of ice
and snow in the headwaters of all these streams, so as to add greatly to
the extent of the deposits in which floating ice is concerned. And this
Columbia formation is, as we understand it, supposed by Mr. McGee to
be the result of this incidental effect of the glacial period in increasing the
accumulations of snow and ice along the headwaters of all the streams that
rise in the Alleghanies. In this we are probably agreed. But Mr. McGee
differs from the interpretation of the facts given by Professor Lewis and
myself, in that he postulates, largely, however, on the basis of facts outside
of this region, two distinct glacial epochs, and attributes the Columbia formation
to the first epoch, which he believes to be from three to ten times as
remote as the period in which the Trenton gravels were deposited. If, therefore,
Dr. Abbott’s implements are, as from the lowest estimate would seem
to be the case, from ten thousand to fifteen thousand years old, the implements
discovered by Mr. Cresson in the Baltimore and Ohio cut at Claymont,
which is certainly in Mr. McGee’s Columbia formation, would be
from thirty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“But as I review the evidence which has come to my knowledge since
writing the paper in 1881, I do not yet see the necessity of making so
complete a separation between the glacial epochs as Mr. McGee and others
feel compelled to do. But, on the other hand, the unity of the epoch (with,
however, a marked period of amelioration in climate accompanied by extensive
recession of the ice, and followed by a subsequent re-advance over
a portion of the territory) seems more and more evident. All the facts
which Mr. McGee adduces from the eastern side of the Alleghanies comport,
apparently, as readily with the idea of one glacial period as with that
of two.... Until further examination of the district with these suggestions
in view, or until a more specific statement of facts than we find in
Mr. McGee’s papers, it would therefore seem unnecessary to postulate a
distinct glacial period to account for the Columbia formation.... But no
matter which view prevails, whether that of two distinct glacial epochs, or
of one prolonged epoch with a mild period intervening, the Columbia deposits
at Claymont, in which these discoveries of Mr. Cresson have been
made, long antedate (perhaps by many thousand years) the deposits at
Trenton, N. J., at Loveland and Madison, Ohio, at Little Falls, Minn., ...
and at Medora, Ind.... Those all belong to the later portion of the
glacial period, while these at Claymont belong to the earlier portion of that
period, if they are not to be classed, according to Mr. McGee, as belonging
to an entirely distinct epoch.”<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a></p>

<p>The objects discovered by both Dr. Metz and Mr. Cresson have been
deposited in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, and their artificial character
cannot be disputed.</p>

<p>At nearly the same date at which Dr. Abbott published the account of
his discoveries, Col. Charles C. Jones, of Augusta, Georgia, recorded the
finding of “some rudely-chipped, triangular-shaped implements in Nacoochee
valley under circumstances which seemingly assign to them very remote
antiquity. In material, manner of construction, and in general appearance,
so nearly do they resemble some of the rough, so-called flint
hatchets belonging to the drift type, as described by M. Boucher de Perthes,
that they might very readily be mistaken the one for the other.”<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a>
They were met with in the course of mining operations, in which a cutting
had been made through the soil and the underlying sands, gravels, and
boulders down to the bedrock. Resting upon this, at a depth of some nine
feet from the surface, were the three implements described. But it is plain
that this deposit can scarcely be regarded as a true glacial drift, since the
great terminal moraine lies more than four hundred miles away to the
north, and the region where it occurs does not fall within the drift area.
It must be of local origin, and few geologists would be willing to admit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
existence of local glaciers in the Alleghanies so far to the south during the
glacial period. Consequently these objects do not fall within our definition
of true palæolithic implements.</p>

<p>The same thing may be said in a less degree of the implements discovered
by C. M. Wallace, in 1876, in the gravels and clays of the valley of
the James River.<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a></p>

<p>A different character attaches to certain objects discovered in 1877 by
Professor N. H. Winchell, at Little Falls, Minnesota, in the valley of the
Mississippi River.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> These consisted mainly of pieces of chipped white
quartz, perfectly sharp, although occurring in a water-worn deposit, and
they were found to extend over quite a large area. Their artificial character
has been vouched for by Professor Putnam, and among them were a
few rude implements which are well represented in an accompanying plate.
A geological section given in the report shows that they occur in the terrace
some sixty feet above the bank of the river, and were found to extend about
four feet below the surface. In the words of Professor Winchell: “The
interest that centres in these chips ... involves the question of the age of
man and his work in the Mississippi Valley.... The chipping race ...
preceded the spreading of the material of the plain, and must have been
pre-glacial, since the plain was spread out by that flood stage of the Mississippi
River that existed during the prevalence of the ice-period, or resulted
from the dissolution of the glacial winter.... The wonderful abundance
of these chips indicates an astonishing amount of work done, as if there
had been a great manufactory in the neighborhood, or an enormous lapse
of time for its performance.”</p>

<p>This discovery of Professor Winchell was followed up by researches
prosecuted in 1879 in the vicinity of Little Falls by Miss F. E. Babbit, of
that place.<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> She discovered a similar stratum of chipped quartz in the
ancient terrace, of a mile or more in width, about forty rods to the east of
the river, and elevated some twenty-five feet above it. This had been
brought to light by the wearing of a wagon track, leading down a natural
drainage channel, which had cut through the quartz stratum down to a
level below it. The result of her prolonged investigations showed that “the
stratum of quartz chips lay at a level some twelve or fifteen feet lower than
the plane of the terrace top.”<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> While the quartz chips discovered by Professor
Winchell were contained in the upper surface of the terrace plain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
these were strictly confined to a lower level, and cannot be synchronous
with them. They must be older “by at least the lapse of time required
for the deposition of the twelve or fifteen feet of modified drift forming
the upper part of the terrace plain above the quartz-bearing stratum.”</p>

<p>This conclusion is abundantly confirmed by Mr. Warren Upham, of the
U. S. Geological Survey, in his study of “The recession of the ice-sheet
in Minnesota in its relation to the gravel deposits overlying the quartz implements
found by Miss Babbit at Little Falls, Minnesota.”<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> The great
ice-sheet of the latest glacial epoch at its maximum extension pushed out
vast lobes of ice, one of which crossed western and central Minnesota and
extended into Iowa. Different stages of its retreat are marked by eleven
distinct marginal moraines, and this deposit of modified drift at Little Falls
Mr. Upham believes occurred in the interval between the formation of the
eighth and the ninth. “It is,” he says, “upon the till, or direct deposit of
the ice, and forms a surface over which the ice never re-advanced.” An
examination of the terraces and plains of the Mississippi Valley from St.
Paul to twenty-five miles above Little Falls shows them to be similar in
composition and origin to the terraces of modified drift in the river valleys
of New England. In his judgment, “the rude implements and fragments
of quartz discovered at Little Falls were overspread by the glacial flood-plain
of the Mississippi River, while most of the northern half of Minnesota
was still covered by the ice.... It may be that the chief cause
leading men to occupy this locality so soon after it was uncovered from
the ice was their discovery of the quartz veins in the slate there, ... affording
suitable material for making sharp-edged stone implements of the best
quality. Quartz veins are absent, or very rare and unsuitable for this, in
all the rock outcrops of the south half of Minnesota, that had become uncovered
from the ice, as well as of the whole Mississippi basin southward,
and this was the first spot accessible whence quartz for implement-making
could be obtained.”</p>

<p>According to this view the upper deposit at Little Falls would appear to
be more recent than those laid down by the immediate wasting of the
great terminal moraine at Trenton and in Ohio; but the occupation of
the spot by man upon the lower terrace may well have been at a much
earlier time.</p>

<p>Many of the objects discovered by Miss Babbitt have been placed in the
Peabody Museum, and as their artificial character has been questioned, the
writer wishes to repeat his opinion, formed upon the study of numerous
specimens that have been submitted to him, but not the same as those upon
which Professor Putnam based his similar conclusions, that they are undoubtedly
of human origin.</p>

<p>Implements of palæolithic form have been discovered in several other
localities, but as none of them have been found <i>in place</i>, in undisturbed
gravel-beds, either those which have been derived from the terminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
moraine of the second extension of the great northern ice-sheet, or those
which are included within the drift area, they cannot be considered as
proved to be true palæolithic implements, although it is highly probable
that many of them are such.<a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a></p>

<p class="p2">We have now to consider the claim to high antiquity of objects which
have been discovered in several places in certain deposits, equally regarded
as of glacial origin, which occur in the central and western portions of the
United States. These are the so-called “lacustrine deposits,” which are
believed to have had their origin from the former presence of vast lakes,
now either extinct or represented by comparatively small bodies of water.
The largest of such lakes occupied a great depression which once existed
between the Rocky Mountains and the chain of the Sierra Nevada during
the quaternary period. The existing lakes represent the lowest part of two
basins, into which this depression was divided; of these, the western one,
represented by certain smaller lakes, has received the name of Lake Lahontan.
This never had any communication with the sea, and its deposits
consequently register the greater or less amount of rain and snow during
the period of its existence. To the eastern the name of Lake Bonneville
has been given, and it is at present represented by the Great Salt Lake in
Utah. This formerly had an outlet through the valley of the Columbia
River. These lakes are believed to have been produced by the melting of
local glaciers existing during the quaternary times in the above-named
mountains; and similar consequences seem to have followed from the like
presence of ancient glaciers in the Wahsatch and Uintah mountains, where
no lake now exists.</p>

<p>In the ancient deposits of such an immense fresh-water lake, derived
from the melting of glaciers in the last-mentioned mountains, which once
existed in southern Wyoming, Professor Joseph Leidy first reported, in
1872, the discovery near Fort Bridger of “mingled implements of the rudest
construction, together with a few of the highest finish.... Some of the
specimens are as sharp and fresh in appearance as if they had been but
recently broken from the parent block. Others are worn and have their
sharpness removed, and are so deeply altered in color as to look exceedingly
ancient.”<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> The plates accompanying the report show that some of these
objects are of palæolithic form, but as no further information is given in
regard to the conditions under which they were discovered, we cannot pronounce
them to be really palæolithic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1874, Dr. Samuel Aughey made known the existence in Nebraska of
“hundreds of miles of similar lacustrine deposits, almost level or gently
rolling.”<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> To these the name of “loess” has also been given, as well as to
the mud deposits derived from the northern drift. Aughey states that
these beds are perfectly homogeneous throughout, and of almost uniform
color, ranging in thickness from five to one hundred and fifty feet. Generally
they lie above a true drift formation derived from glaciers in the Black
Hills, and represent “the final retreat of the glaciers, and that era of depression
of the surface of the State when the greater part of it constituted
a great fresh-water lake, into which the Missouri, the Platte, and the Republican
rivers poured their waters.” The Missouri and its tributaries,
flowing for more than one thousand miles through these deposits, gradually
filled up this great lake with sediment. The rising of the land by
degrees converted the lake-bottom into marshes, through which the rivers
began to cut new channels, and to form the bluffs which now bound them.
“The Missouri, during the closing centuries of the lacustrine age, must
have been from five to thirty miles in breadth, forming a stream which for
size and majesty rivalled the Amazon.” Many remains of mastodons and
elephants are found in this so-called loess, as well as those of the animals
now living in that region, together with the fresh-water and land shells
peculiar to it. In it Aughey has also discovered an arrow-point and a
spear-head, of which he gives well-executed figures. Both are excellent
examples of those well-chipped implements which are regarded as typical
of the Neolithic age or the age of polished stone, and are absolutely different
from the palæolithic implements of which we have hitherto spoken.
They were both found in railroad cuttings on the Iowa side of the Missouri
River, and within three miles of it. The first lay at a depth of fifteen feet
below the top of the deposit. Of the second he says it was “twenty feet
below the top of the loess, and at least six inches from the edge of the cut,
so that it could not have slid into that place.... Thirteen inches above
the point where it was found, and within three inches of being on a line
with it, in undisturbed loess, there was a lumbar vertebra of an elephant.”<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a></p>

<p>This intermingling in these deposits of the bones of extinct and living
animals appears to have been brought about by the shifting of the beds of
the vast rivers he has described, which have been flowing for ages through
the slight and easily moved material. It seems to be analogous to what
has taken place in recent times in the valley of the Mississippi and in its
delta. The finding, therefore, of arrow-heads of recent Indian type, even <i>in
place</i> under twenty feet of loess and below a fossil elephant-bone, cannot
be considered as affording any stronger proof of the antiquity of man than
the oft-cited instances of the discovery of basket-work and pottery underneath
similar fossils at Petite Anse Island in Louisiana, or of pottery and
mastodon-bones on the banks of the Ashley River in South Carolina. No
such discovery can be considered of consequence as bearing upon the
question of palæolithic man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The late Thomas Belt wrote to Professor Putnam, in 1878, that he had
discovered “a small human skull in an undisturbed loess in a railway cutting
about two miles from Denver (Colorado). All the plains are covered with
a drift deposit of granitic and quartzose pebbles overlaid by a sandy and
calcareous loam closely resembling the diluvial clay and the loess of
Europe. It was in the upper part of the drift series that I found the skull.
Just the tip of it was visible in the cutting about three and one half feet
below the surface.”<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> Not long after this Mr. Belt died, and we are without
further information in regard to the locality. It would seem, however,
that the loess in which the skull occurred belongs to the latest in the
lacustrine series, and consequently does not imply any very great antiquity
for it.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pf400">Found in the Lahontan sediments,&mdash;from a cut in Russell’s <i>Lake Lahontan</i>, monograph xi. of Powell’s
<i>U. S. Geological Survey</i>, p. 247.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In 1882 Mr. W. J. McGee, of the U. S. Geological Survey, obtained
from the upper lacustral clays of the basin of the ancient Lake Lahontan,
where they are exposed in the walls of Walker River Cañon, a spear-head,
made of obsidian, beautifully chipped, and perfectly resembling those found
on the surface throughout the southwest. “It was discovered projecting
point outwards from a vertical scarp of lacustral clays twenty-five feet below
the top of the section, at a locality where there were no signs of recent
disturbance.”<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> This is said to have been “associated in such a manner
with the bones of an elephant or mastodon as to leave no doubt of their
having been buried at approximately the same time.” But we are also told
that these lakes are of very recent date, and that they have “left the very
latest of all the complete geological records to be observed in the Great
Basin.”<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> The fossil shells obtained from these deposits all belong to
living species; while the mammalian remains, which have been found in
only very limited numbers, and all, with a single exception, in the upper
beds, “are the same as occur elsewhere in tertiary or quaternary strata.”
Mr. McGee says: “If the obsidian implement ... was really <i>in situ</i> (as
all appearances indicated), it must have been dropped in a shallow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
quiet bay of the saline and alkaline Lake Lahontan, and gradually buried
beneath its fine mechanical deposits and chemical precipitates.”<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a></p>

<p>In Mr. Russell’s opinion, this single implement, although supported by
no other finds of a similar character, is sufficient to prove that “man
inhabited this continent during the last great rise of the former lake.”
But if this last great rise occurred in recent times, the presence of the
bones of tertiary mammals in the upper beds shows that great natural
forces must have been in operation at that time to have washed these out
of their original place of deposit. The principal organic remains found, we
are told, are those of living shells, and the intermingling of these with
the bones of tertiary mammals could scarcely have taken place in “shallow
and quiet bays.” To the writer this discovery seems rather to prove that
an Indian spear-head was in some manner washed down and buried in the
clays of the Walker River Cañon than that man was the contemporary
there of the tertiary or quaternary mammalia. This fairly seems to be a
case where, in the language of Dr. Brinton, “Archæology may at times
correct Geology.”<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a></p>

<p>It is almost paralleled by the discovery made by Mr. P. A. Scott, in
Kansas, of a broken knife or lance-head, measuring in its present condition
two inches and one eighth in length. Sir Daniel Wilson, who reports it,
says: “The spot where the discovery was made is in the Blue Range of the
Rocky Mountains, in an alluvial bottom, and distant several hundred feet
from a small stream called Clear Creek. A shaft was sunk, passing through
four feet of rich, black soil, and below this through upward of ten feet of
gravel, reddish clay, and rounded quartz. Here the flint was found....
The actual object corresponds more to the small and slighter productions
of the modern Indian tool-maker than to the rude and massive drift implement.”
But this most careful and conscientious observer goes on to
remark, “Under any circumstances it would be rash to build up comprehensive
theories on a solitary case like this.”<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a></p>

<p>If the discovery by Mr. McGee of this spear-head be insisted upon as
establishing that man inhabited this continent during the last great rise
of the lake, it would be easier to believe that that event occurred in
recent and not in quaternary times, than to admit that the distinction
between palæolithic and neolithic implements, established by so many
discoveries in this country and in Europe, is thereby utterly overthrown.</p>

<p>The only alternative left is to believe that neolithic man was the contemporary
of the tertiary mammals. To this conclusion we are asked to come
by Professor Josiah D. Whitney, on account of the discovery of the remains
of man and of his works in the auriferous gravels of California. The
famous “Calaveras skull” is figured upon another page of this volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
where the circumstances attending its discovery are briefly referred to.<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a>
It is astonishing to see how frail is the foundation upon which such a
surprising superstructure has been raised, as it is found set forth in detail
in the section entitled <i>Human remains and works of art of the gravel series</i>,
in the third chapter of Professor Whitney’s memoir on <i>The auriferous
gravels of the Sierra Nevada of California</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> All is hearsay testimony, and
entirely uncontrolled by any such careful scrutiny as marks the work of
the British Association in the explorations carried on for fifteen years at
Kent’s Hole, near Torquay. There can be no question that human bones
and human implements have often been discovered in these gravels, but
according to the accounts as given these are mingled in them in inextricable
confusion. What is the character of these objects of human workmanship?
So far are they from being, as Professor Whitney describes them, “always
the same kind of implements, ... namely, the coarsest and the least
finished which one would suppose could be made and still be implements.”
One account speaks of “a spear or lance head of obsidian, five inches long
and one and a half broad, quite regularly formed.” Others mention “spear
and arrow heads made of obsidian;” or “certain discoidal stones from
three to four inches in diameter, and about an inch and a half thick, concave
on both sides, with perforated centre.” Still another witness speaks
of “a large stone bead, made perhaps of alabaster, about one and a half
inches long and about one and one fourth inches in diameter, with a hole
through it one fourth of an inch in size.” We are also told of a “stone
hatchet of a triangular shape, with a hole through it for a handle, near the
middle. Its size was four inches across the edge, and length about six
inches.” So also oval stones with continuous “grooves cut around them,”
and “grooved oval disks,” are more than once mentioned. We think these
quotations will be sufficient to convince the archæologist that here is no
question of palæolithic implements, but that we have to do simply with the
common Indian objects found on the surface all over our country. Besides
the rude cuts in Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> I know of only one example of these California
discoveries which has been figured. This is the “beautiful relic” described
by Mr. J. W. Foster, of which he says: “When we consider its symmetry
of form ... and the delicate drilling of the hole through a material so
liable to fracture, we are free to say it affords an exhibition of the lapidary’s
skill superior to anything yet furnished by the Stone age of either continent.”<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a>
Mr. Foster doubtfully suggests that this object was “used as a
plummet for the purpose of determining the perpendicular to the horizon.”
It has been shown, however, by Mr. W. H. Henshaw, that among the
Indians of Southern California similar objects have long been used by
their medicine-men as “medicine or sorcery stones.”<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> Whichever may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
be held to be the true explanation of its use, either is more likely to be a
characteristic of the Indian race than of primitive man.</p>

<p>But the objects whose presence in the gravels is most repeatedly spoken
of are stone mortars, which Professor Whitney supposes were “used by
the race inhabiting this region in prehistoric times ... for providing food.”
One of these is stated to have been “found standing upright, and the
pestle was in it, in its proper place, apparently just as it had been left by
the owner.” It was taken out of a shaft, according to the testimony,
twelve feet underneath undisturbed strata. This was certainly a very
marvellous thing to have happened if all the objects found in the gravels
are supposed to have been brought there by the action of floods of water.
But it is a very simple matter, if the supposition of Mr. Southall be correct,
who thinks that “these mortars have been left in these positions by the
ancient inhabitants in their search for <i>gold</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> The Spaniards found gold
in abundance in Mexico, and the locality from which it came is believed by
Mr. Southall to be indicated by a discovery made in 1849 by some gold-diggers
at one of the mountain diggings called Murphy’s, in the region in
which Professor Whitney’s discoveries have taken place. In examining a
high barren district of mountain, they were surprised to come upon the
abandoned site of an ancient mine. At the bottom of a shaft two hundred
and ten feet deep a human skeleton was found, with an altar for worship
and other evidences of ancient labor by the aborigines.<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> Mr. Southall
believes that these mortars were used “for crushing the cemented gravel
of the auriferous beds.” Some corroboration is afforded for this suggestion
by the fact that stone mortars of a like character are found in the ancient
gold mines, worked by the early Egyptian monarchs, in the Gebel Allakee
Mountains near the Red Sea, which were used in pulverizing the gold-bearing
quartz.</p>

<p>As to the authenticity of the “Calaveras skull,”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“Great contest followed and much learned dust.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The probabilities seem in favor of its being a genuine human fossil, and the
question recurs as to its character and the presumable age of the deposits
from which it came. The latest geologist who has studied the locality, so
far as the writer is aware, says of these deposits: “Even before visiting
California I had suspected these old river gravels might be contemporaneous
with the glacial epoch, and I still think this possible. This area was not
glaciated, and these old gravels, hundreds of feet in thickness, may very
well represent that great interval of time occupied in other regions by the
glacial periods.”<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> In discussing this question from the point of view of the
character of the fossil animal remains contained in the gravels, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
continually bear in mind what Professor E. D. Cope says of the <i>Mesozoic
and Cænozoic of North America</i>: “The faunæ of these periods have not yet
been discriminated.... Many questions of the exact contemporaneity of
these different beds are as yet unsettled.”<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> Professor Cope has previously
pointed out how marked a difference there is between the quaternary fauna
of North America and that of Europe; we have no Hippopotamus or
Rhinoceros Tichorinus, and they no Megatherium, Megalonyx, and other
species. Under the varying conditions of animal existence thus implied,
to assail established ideas upon the sequence in man’s development, or to
maintain that he has had a long career on the Pacific slope of our continent
before he had made his appearance in Western Europe, seems to the writer
to be an attempt to explain “<i>ignotum per ignotius</i>.”</p>

<p>What is really to be understood by the assumption that man existed in
tertiary times? So profound a palæontologist as Professor William Boyd
Dawkins thinks “it is impossible to believe that man should have been an
exception to the law of change. In the Pliocene age we cannot expect to
find traces of man upon the earth. The living placental mammals had only
then begun to appear, and seeing that the higher animals have invariably
appeared in the rocks according to their place in the zoölogical scale, fishes,
amphibians, reptiles, placental mammals, it is hardly reasonable to suppose
that the highest of all should then have been upon the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> When,
therefore, some of the geologists of our country support Professor Whitney’s
claim that these discoveries of human fossils have actually proved
man’s existence in the Pliocene period, by arguments mainly based upon the
effects of erosion and the immense periods of time which these imply, or
favor his inference from the animal fossils contained in these deposits that
there has been “a total change in the fauna and flora of the region,” and
that “the fauna of the gravel deposits is almost exclusively made up of
extinct species,” we may well insist, with Dawkins, that the human remains
should not be regarded as standing upon a different basis from those of
the horse, since both occur under similar conditions. Dr. Leidy reports
the finding of remains of four different species of fossil <i>Equus</i>. But among
them “we may note the skull of a mustang, identical with that of Mexico
and California, which could not have been buried in the gravels of Sierra
County before the time of the Spanish Conquest, when the living race of
horses was introduced.” Professor Jeffries Wyman says of the Calaveras
skull: “Any conclusions based upon a single skull are liable to prove erroneous,
unless we have sufficient grounds for the belief that such a skull is
a representative one of the race to which it belongs.... We have no sufficient
reason for assuming in the present instance that the skull is a representative
one.... The skull presents no signs of having belonged to an
inferior race. In its breadth it agrees with the other crania from California,
except those of the Diggers, but surpasses them in the other particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
in which comparisons have been made.”<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> As, therefore, what appear to be
the skulls of a California Indian and that of a Mexican mustang have been
found to occur in the same deposits, this circumstance, instead of proving
that man was an inhabitant of pliocene America, would seem to the writer
to imply either that these deposits are comparatively recent, or that the
fossil bones found in them are so commingled that arguments based upon
purely palæontological considerations can be regarded as entitled to very
little weight.</p>

<p>But although some American palæontologists are inclined to argue that
these deposits belong to the Pliocene, on account of the character of the
vertebrate fossils found in them, it must not be forgotten that geologists
generally prefer to refer them to the Pleistocene. They believe that even
the superimposition of lava beds upon the gravels does not establish a very
high antiquity for them, and question whether the time that has elapsed
since the outflow of the lava, as measured by the amount of erosion that has
taken place in the gravels, is to be regarded as much greater than can properly
be assigned to the Pleistocene period elsewhere. Professor Whitney
himself admits the difficulty of distinguishing whether “deposits have been
accumulated in the place where we find them previous to the cessation of
the period of volcanic activity. The gravels which have not been protected
by a capping of basalt, or only thinly or not at all covered by erupted materials,
may in some places have been overlain by recent deposits in such a
way that the line between volcanic and post-volcanic cannot be distinctly
drawn.... It must not unfrequently have happened that fossils have been
washed out of the less coherent detrital beds belonging to the volcanic
series, carried far from their original resting-place, and deposited in such a
position that they seem to belong to the present epoch.”<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> In one of the
reports of Hayden’s survey can be seen a plate representing “Modern
Lake Deposits capped with Basalt.”<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> There is sufficient ground for believing
that the volcanic activity of the regions of the Sierras has continued
down to very recent times, geologically speaking, and that there is no such
great difference of age between the lava-cappings and the other beds as
Professor Whitney supposes. Hayden thinks “the main portion of the
volcanic material of the West has been thrown out at a comparatively
modern date.”<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> Undoubtedly the amount of erosion that has taken place
in these river gravels implies a great lapse of time, but so do the other facts
of physical geography which have been employed as chronometers by which
to measure the time since the close of the quaternary period. To carry
this erosion back to the tertiary times, and to assign man his place in the
world then on that ground, in face of the arguments to the contrary drawn
from archæology, palæontology, and geology, in view of the essential weakness
of the testimony upon which the arguments in its favor are based,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
would seem to be a most hazardous assumption. It is only equalled by the
statement that “the discoveries made in Europe, which have already obtained
general credence, carry man close to the verge of the tertiary; if not,
indeed, a little the other side of the line.”<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> In the writer’s opinion, this is
the belief of only a small number of the most extreme evolutionists in
Europe, while the great body of cautious and critical observers think that
it has not been proved, and a few are willing to hold their judgment in
suspense.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney’s conclusions, however, are supported by Mr. Wallace
in the article quoted at the beginning of this chapter, in his character as
an evolutionist of the most advanced school. He says: “Believing that
the whole bearing of the comparative anatomy of man and of the anthropoid
apes, together with the absence of indications of any essential change in
his structure during the quaternary period, lead to the conclusion that he
<i>must</i> have existed, as man, in pliocene times, and that the intermediate
forms connecting him with the higher apes probably lived during the early
pliocene or the miocene period, it is urged that all such discoveries ...
are in themselves probable and such as we have a right to expect.”<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a> In
such a frame of mind it is very easy for him to wave aside every objection
raised by the archæologist to the character of the evidence brought forward
to sustain the alleged discoveries. To the objection that the objects accompanying
the human remains, for which such a great antiquity is claimed,
are too similar to those of comparatively recent times, he has a ready answer:
“The same may be said of the most ancient bow and spear-heads
and those made by modern Indians. The use of the articles has in both
cases been continuous, and the objects themselves are so necessary and so
comparatively simple that there is no room for any great modification of
form.” The writer can only state here that no archæologist holds this
opinion, and will refer for a detailed statement of his reasons for the contrary
view to an article by him upon <i>The Bow and Arrow unknown to
Palæolithic Man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1536_1536" id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a></p>

<p>It is not easy to believe that so vast a difference in age can be attributed
to the deposits upon the opposite sides of the chain of the Sierra Nevada,
as would follow if we are to hold that the auriferous gravels belong to the
tertiary, while the Lahontan deposits belong to the quaternary period.
Far more reasonable does it seem to suppose that they both fall within the
two divisions into which we have seen that the pleistocene has been divided.
To the writer it appears, from what study he has made of the evidences
alleged of man’s existence in North America in early times, that proof is
wanting that he made his appearance here earlier than in interglacial times.
Dr. Abbott’s discoveries seem to be worthy of all the importance which has
been assigned to them, and the more so from the fact that they are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
accord with similar discoveries made in the Old World. The evidence
adduced appears to be altogether too fragmentary and strained to warrant
the conclusion that has been drawn that there is no proper correlation
between the geological calendars of the two hemispheres.</p>

<p>Besides the numerous palæolithic implements which the Trenton gravels
have yielded, there have been found in them three human crania, more
or less complete, and portions of others.<a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a> Professor Putnam is inclined
to the opinion that these may be veritable remains of the makers of the
palæolithic implements. But it is difficult to conceive how such fragile
objects as human skulls, in this period and at this locality, could have
survived the destructive forces to which they must have been subjected.
We must recollect that the bones of man are very seldom met with in
the river gravels of the Old World, and such crania as are accepted
as belonging to these deposits are dolichocephalic, and not, like these,
brachycephalic.<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a> The circumstances under which these three have been
found are not reported with sufficient detail to enable us to account satisfactorily
for their presence, nor can we admit that the fact that they
“are not of the Delaware Indian type” affords any adequate criterion for
our judgment. It is well established that “in America we find extreme
brachycephaly, as well among the prehistoric as among the historic peoples
from British America to Patagonia. At the same time, dolichocephaly is
found, besides among the Eskimos, throughout the American Indian tribes
from north to south; but it cannot be considered an American craniologic
characteristic.”<a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a> The various forms of skulls, moreover, are found to be so
intermingled that they have been compared to “what might be looked for
in a collection made from the potter’s field of London or New York.”<a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a>
The problem is still further complicated by the widespread custom among
the American tribes of altering the natural shape of the skull, sometimes
by flattening it, sometimes by making it as round as possible.<a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> Taking all
these matters into consideration, we are compelled to regard craniology by
itself as an insufficient guide.</p>

<p>We have now passed in review such evidences of man’s early existence
in North America as seem to be sufficiently substantiated by satisfactory
proof, and have intentionally left out of consideration many former examples,
which were accustomed to be cited before the science of prehistoric
archæology had formulated her laws and established her general conclusions,
as well as some more recent ones in which the evidence seems to be
weak.</p>

<p>It only remains for the writer to express his own conclusions on the
question. But first let him draw attention to the state of public opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
upon this subject as it is well expressed by an English writer: “The evidence
for the existence of palæolithic man in America has been more fiercely
contested even than in Europe, and the problem there is certainly more
complicated. In Europe we can test the age of the remains not merely by
their actual character, but also by the presence or absence of associated
domestic animals. In America this test is absent, for there were virtually
no domestic animals save the dog known to the pre-European inhabitants.
We are therefore remitted to less direct evidence, namely, the provenance
of the remains from beds of distinctly Pleistocene age, the fabric of the
remains, and their association with animals, we have reason to believe,
become extinct at the termination of that period.”<a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a></p>

<p>As an example of the spirit in which this “fierce contest” is waged in
America, it will be sufficient to quote a few passages from a work by one
of her most eminent men of science. He is speaking of “what seems to
be a village site in Europe, of far greater antiquity than the Swiss lake-villages,
and which may be a veritable ‘Palæolithic’ antediluvian town. It
occurs at Solutré, near Mâcon, in eastern France, and has given rise to
much discussion and controversy, as described by Messrs. De Ferry and
Arcelin.... It destroys utterly the pretension that the men of the mammoth
age were an inferior race, or ruder than their successors in the later
stone age.... Lastly, many of the flint weapons of Solutré are of the
palæolithic type characteristic of the river gravels, ... while other implements
and weapons are as well worked as those of the later stone age.
Thus this singular deposit connects these two so-called ages, and fuses
them into one.”<a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> The only comment the writer will make upon this statement
is to say that he has twice visited the station at Solutré in company
with M. Arcelin; that he has examined the collection of the late M. De
Ferry at his house; and that he has before him the work which is supposed
to be quoted from,<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> and he accordingly feels warranted in asserting
with confidence that not one “flint implement of the palæolithic type characteristic
of the river gravels” was ever found at Solutré. A note appended
to Sir J. W. Dawson’s rash statement adds: “Recent discoveries
by M. Prunières, in caves at Beaumes Chaudes, seem to show that the
older cave-men were in contact with more advanced tribes, as arrow-heads
of the so-called neolithic type are found sticking in their bones, or associated
with them. This would form another evidence of the little value to
be attached to the distinction of the two ages of stone.” The writer has
already indicated his conviction that palæolithic man had not advanced
sufficiently to invent the bow and arrow, and he wishes to add here that
“arrow-heads of the so-called neolithic type” continued to be ordinary
weapons employed during the Age of Bronze. He is only surprised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Dr. Prunières’ discoveries are not quoted to prove that there is no distinction
between the Age of Stone and the Age of Bronze.</p>

<p>Tested by the canons of prehistoric archæology, superposition, association,
and style, in the judgment of the writer the fact of the existence of
palæolithic man upon this continent, and the distinction between the rude
palæolithic implement and the skilfully chipped obsidian objects which belong
to what is called in Europe the Solutré type (a development of the
later period in the early stone age, which cannot be overlooked in discussing
the question of the antiquity of man), are truths as firmly established
as any taught by modern science. The small minority who refuse to admit
the last stated proposition are laggards in her march, and the few
doubters who still question the genuineness of the palæolithic implements
from the Trenton gravels are not entitled by their knowledge of the processes
of manufacturing stone implements to have much weight attached
to their opinions.</p>

<p>Regarding, then, the existence of palæolithic man as established by the
finding of four hundred of his relics in the Delaware valley near Trenton,
we have next to inquire whether there is evidence that in that region man
made any progress towards the neolithic condition. For an answer to this
question we have only to study the immense collection of objects gathered
by Dr. Abbott, and now deposited in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge.
This seems to warrant a conclusion exactly the opposite to Professor Whitney’s,
who states that “so far as California is concerned ... the implements,
tools, and works of art obtained are throughout in harmony with
each other, all being the simplest and least artistic of which it is possible
to conceive;” and his further statement that the “rude tools required but
little more skill than is indicated by the chipped obsidian implements which
are now, and have been from all time, in use among the aborigines of this
continent.”<a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a></p>

<p>We have already seen that Professor Whitney’s inferences about the
relics of man occurring in the gravels of California are not at all justified
by the facts relating to their discovery as reported by him; and as he
offers no proof of his other assertion that “chipped obsidian implements
have been <i>for all time</i> in use among the aborigines of this continent,” we
will venture to question its accuracy, even should he argue that his loose
statement was intended to apply only to the aborigines of California. Consequently
we are somewhat at a loss to understand why Dr. Abbott should
feel called upon to refute his conclusions. He does this, however, successfully
in his <i>Primitive Industry</i>, which is so largely based upon this great
collection as to answer satisfactorily as a catalogue for it. In his own
words, “the careful and systematic examination of the surface geology of
New Jersey, of itself, it is believed, shows as abundant and unmistakable
evidence of the transition from a true palæolithic to a neolithic condition as
is exhibited in the traces of human handiwork found in the valley of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
European river.”<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> The arguments upon which this conclusion is based are
drawn from each of the three canons of prehistoric archæology. A certain
class of objects, superior in form and finish to the rude palæolithic implement,
but decidedly inferior in every respect to the common types of
Indian manufacture, with which collectors of such objects all over our
country are perfectly familiar, is found occurring <i>principally</i> in deposits
which occupy a position intermediate between the drift gravels, from which
come the palæolithic implements, and the cultivable surface-soil, in which
the former implements of the Indians are constantly brought to light by the
ordinary operations of agriculture. In other instances, where these peculiar
objects are found on or near the surface, not only do they not always
occur there in association with the common Indian relics, but the material
of which they are made, argillite, is the same as that out of which all the
four hundred palæolithic implements are fabricated, with the exception of
“two of quartz, one of quartzite, and one made from a black chert pebble.”<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a>
This peculiar material occurs <i>in place</i> only a few miles north of Trenton,
and as the ice-sheet withdrew it afforded “the first available mineral for
effective implements other than pebbles, and these were largely covered
with water, and not so readily obtained as at present; while the dry land
of that day, the Columbia gravel, contained almost exclusively in this
region small quartzite pebbles an inch or two in length.”<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> The objects
thus referred to exhibit only a few simple types. There is a rudely chipped
spear-head, about three or four inches in length and from one to two in
breadth, characterized by the same kind of decomposition of the surface
which is seen upon the palæolithic implements. These occur in large
numbers; “as many as a thousand have been found in an area of fifty
acres.... A peculiarity ... is their frequent occurrence ... at a depth
that suggests that they were lost when the face of the country was different
from what it now is.”<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> An implement is often found which was
probably used as a knife, also very rudely chipped, and shaped somewhat
like a spear-head, but never having a sharp point. The argillite, of which
these are made, “is very hard and susceptible of being brought to a very
sharp edge,” but they are now all much decomposed upon the surface, and
“are frequently brought to light through land-slides and the uprooting of
trees from depths greater than it is usual to find jasper implements”<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> of
the Indians.</p>

<p>The most common object of all, however, and one that occurs in very
large numbers, is a slender argillite spear-point, about three inches in
length, of nearly uniform size, and having little or no finish at the base.
These are found at various depths up to five feet, principally in the alluvial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
mud that has accumulated upon the meadows skirting the Delaware
River, that are liable to be overflowed occasionally by the tide. From this
circumstance, in addition to their shape, Dr. Abbott has conjectured that
they were used as fish-spears.<a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> “This deposit of mud is of a deep blue-black
color, stiff in consistency, and almost wholly free from pebbles. It
is composed of decomposed vegetable matter and a large percentage of
very fine sand. It varies in depth from four to twenty feet, and rests on an
old gravel of an origin antedating the river gravels that contain palæolithic
implements. This mud is the geological formation next succeeding the
palæolithic implement-bearing gravels.... A careful survey of this mud
deposit, made at several distant points, leads to the conclusion that its formation
dates from the exposure of the older gravel upon which it rests,
through the gradual lessening of the bulk of the river, until it occupied only
its present channel.... The indications are that the present volume and
channel of the river have been essentially as they now are for a very long
period; and the character of the deposit is such that its accumulation, if
principally from decomposition of vegetable matter, must necessarily be
very gradual. Since its accumulation to a depth sufficient to sustain tree
growth, forests have grown, decayed, and been replaced by a growth of
other timber. While so recent in origin that it seems scarcely to warrant
the attention of the geologist, its years of growth are nevertheless to be
numbered by centuries, and the traces of man found at all depths through
it hint of a distant, shadowy past that is difficult to realize.</p>

<p>“The same objection, it may be, will be urged in this instance as in others
where the comparative antiquity of man is based upon the depth at which
stone implements are found,&mdash;that all these traces have been left upon the
present surface of the ground, and subsequently have gotten, by unexplained
means, to the various depths at which they now occur. It is, indeed,
difficult to realize how some of these argillite spear-points have
finally sunk through a compact peaty mass until they have reached the very
base of the deposit. For those who urge that this sinking process explains
the occurrence of implements at great depths, it remains to demonstrate
that the people who made these argillite fish-spears either made only these,
or were careful to take no other evidences of their handicraft with them
when they wandered about these meadows; for certainly nothing else appears
to have shared the fate of sinking deeply into the mud. In fact, the
objection mentioned is met in this case, as in that of the palæolithic implements,
that if these fish-spears are of the same age and origin as the ordinary
Indian relics of the surface, then all alike should be found at great depths.
This, we know, is not the case. Furthermore, the character of the deposit
is not that of a loose mud or quicksand, but more like that of peat. It has
a close texture, is tough and unyielding to a degree, and offers decided
resistance to the sinking of comparatively light objects deeply into it. This
is, of course, lessened when the deposit is subject to tidal overflows, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the immediate vicinity of springs, which, bubbling through it, have caused
a deposit of quicksand. While here an object sinks instantly out of sight,
it is not here that we must judge of the character of the formation as a
whole; and over the greater portion of its area we find no evidence of
objects disappearing beneath the surface at a more rapid rate than the
accumulation of decomposing vegetable matter would explain. Efforts
have been made to determine the rate of progress of this growth of mould,
but they are not wholly satisfactory; nevertheless the indications are sufficient
to warrant our belief that the rate is so gradual as to invest with great
archæological interest the characteristic traces of man found in these alluvial
deposits.”</p>

<p>Although these argillite spear-points seem <i>principally</i> to occur, as has
been stated, in the alluvial mud along the banks of the Delaware, yet they
are often found upon the surface, and associated with objects of Indian
origin. This circumstance Dr. Abbott attempts to explain by the following
considerations: “One marked result of the deforesting of the country and
its constant cultivation has been to remove in great part the many inequalities
of the surface and to dry up many of the smaller brooks. The hillocks
have been worn down, the valleys filled up, and this of course has resulted
in bringing to the surface, on the higher ground, the argillite implements
which were at considerable depths, and in burying in the valleys the more
recent jasper and quartz implements of Indian origin that were left upon
the soil when lost or discarded by the red man. In the remnants of forests
still remaining, where no such disturbance of the soil has occurred, the
relative depths at which argillite and jasper respectively occur indicate the
greater age of the former.”<a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a></p>

<p>He recurs to this subject in another place:<a name="FNanchor_1553_1553" id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> “The telling fact with reference
to these argillite spear-points is that they are not, in the same sense
as jasper arrow-heads, surface-found implements. They occur also, and
even more abundantly, beneath the surface-soil. The celebrated Swedish
naturalist, Peter Kalm, travelled throughout central and southern New
Jersey in 1748-50, and in his description of the country remarks: ‘We
find great woods here, but when the trees in them have stood a hundred
and fifty or a hundred and eighty years, they are either rotting within or
losing their crown, or their wood becomes quite soft, or their roots are no
longer able to draw in sufficient nourishment, or they die from some other
cause. Therefore, when storms blow, which sometimes happens here, the
trees are broken off either just above the roots, or in the middle, or at the
summit. Several trees are likewise torn out with their roots by the power
of the winds.... In this manner the old trees die away continually, and
are succeeded by a younger generation. Those which are thrown down lie
on the ground and putrefy, sooner or later, and by that means increase the
<i>black soil</i>, into which the leaves are likewise finally changed, which drop
abundantly in autumn, are blown about by the winds for some time, but are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
heaped up and lie on both sides of the trees which are fallen down. It
requires several years before a tree is entirely reduced to dust.’<a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> This
quotation has a direct bearing on that which follows. It is clear that the
surface-soil was forming during the occupancy of the country by the Indians.
The entire area of the State was covered with a dense forest, which
century after century was increasing the <i>black soil</i> to which Kalm refers.
If, now, an opportunity occurs to examine a section of virgin soil and underlying
strata, as occasionally happens on the bluffs facing the river, the
limit in depth of this black soil may be approximately determined. An
average derived from several such sections leads me to infer that the depth
is not much over one foot, and the proportion of vegetable matter increases
as the surface is approached. Of this depth of superficial soil probably not
over one half has been derived from decomposition of vegetable growths.
While no positive data are determinable in this matter beyond the naked
fact that rotting trees increase the bulk of top-soil, one archæological
fact that we do derive is that <i>flint implements</i> known as Indian relics
belong to this superficial or ‘black soil,’ as Kalm terms it. Abundantly
are they found on the surface; more sparingly are they found near the
surface; more sparingly still the deeper we go; while at the base of this
deposit of soil the <i>argillite</i> implements occur in greatest abundance. Here,
then, we have the whole matter in a nut-shell. The two forms were dissociated
until by the deforesting of the country and subsequent cultivation of
the soil, except in a few instances, they became commingled.”</p>

<p>A further argument in respect to the relation which argillite implements
bear to those made of jasper and quartz is derived from the relative proportion
in which they occur in localities which are believed to have been occupied
first by the users of argillite, and subsequently by the Indians. “Of
a series of twenty thousand objects gathered in Mercer County, New Jersey,
forty-four hundred were of argillite, and of such rude forms and in such
limited varieties as would be expected of the productions of a less cultured
people than the Indian of the stone age. Of this series of forty-four hundred,
two hundred and thirty-three are well-designed drills or perforators and
scrapers; the others being spear-points, fishing-spears, arrow-heads, and
knife-like implements.”<a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> This is supplemented by negative evidence drawn
from “the character of the sites of arrow-makers’ open-air workshops, or
those spots whereon the professional chipper of flint pursued his calling.
In the locality where I have pursued my studies several such sites have
been discovered and carefully examined. In no one of these workshop
sites has there been found any trace of argillite mingled with the flint-chips
that form the characteristic feature of such spots. On the other hand, no
similar sites have been discovered, to my knowledge, where argillite was
used exclusively. The absence of this mineral cannot be explained on the
ground that it was difficult to procure, for such is not the case. It constitutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
in fact, a considerable percentage of the pebbles and boulders of
the drift from which the Indians gathered their jasper and quartz pebbles
for working into implements and weapons. If the absence of argillite from
such heaps of selected stones is explained by the assertion that the Indians
had recognized the superiority of jasper, then the belief that argillite was
used prior to jasper receives tacit assent. If, however, it was the earlier
<i>Indians</i> who used argillite, and gradually discarded it for the various forms
of flint, then we ought to find workshop sites older than the time of <i>flint</i>-chipping,
and others where the two minerals are associated. This, as has
been stated, has not been done.”<a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a></p>

<p>Professor Putnam has found a confirmation of these views of Dr. Abbott
in the contents of a great shell-heap at Keyport, in New Jersey, investigated
over thirty years ago by Rev. Samuel Lockwood, and now placed
in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge. “As the shell-heap at Keyport,
once covering a mile or more in length along a narrow strip bordered upon
one side by the ocean and on the other by Raritan Bay, is entirely obliterated,
it is of importance that the materials obtained from it are now in
the museum for comparison with our very extensive collections from the
shell-heaps of New England. The fact that at certain places on this
narrow strip between the bay and the sea the prevailing implements
were of argillite and of great antiquity has a peculiar significance in connection
with those from Trenton, and again points to an intermediate
period between the palæolithic and the late Indian occupation of New
Jersey.”<a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a></p>

<p>To these various arguments the writer wishes to add the statement that
to his personal knowledge argillite spear-points, and especially those of
the fish-spear type, are occasionally found in other parts of our country
besides New Jersey. In his own researches, which have been principally
carried on upon the seacoast of New England, he has <i>never</i> found an
example of them in the shell-heaps proper, which are universally recognized
by archæologists as relics of the Indians. The few which he has
found himself, or has obtained from others, have come from meadows by
the side of rivers or ponds, where they might very well have been used as
fish-spears.</p>

<p>A further confirmation of Dr. Abbott’s opinions in regard to the descendants
of palæolithic man is derived from certain discoveries made by Mr.
Hilborne T. Cresson in the alluvial deposits at Naaman’s Creek, in Delaware.
These were first made known in November, 1887, by a letter to the
editor of the American Antiquarian. “In 1870, a fisherman living in the
village of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, gave me some spear and arrow heads
flaked from a dense argillite, as well as other rude implements of a prehistoric
people, which he had found on some extensive mud flats near the
mouth of Naaman’s Creek, a small tributary of the Delaware. The finder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
stated that while fishing ... he had noticed here and there the ends of logs
or stakes protruding from the mud, and that they seemed to him to have
been placed in rows.... A visit made a few days afterward to the place
... disclosed the ends of much-decayed stakes or piles protruding here
and there above the mud.... On my return from France in 1880 I again
visited the spot.... While abroad I studied in spare moments many
archæological collections, especially those from the Swiss Lake Dwellings,
and visited the various lake stations of Switzerland. The rude dressings of
the ends of the piles in some places were evidently made with blunt stone
implements, and recalled those I had seen on the ends of the posts in the
Delaware River marshes. Since 1880 I have quietly examined the remains,
excavating what pile ends remained <i>in situ</i> (preserving a few that did not
crumble to pieces), preserving careful notes of the dredging and excavations
(at low tides), carried on principally by myself, aided at times by interested
friends. The results so far seem to indicate that the ends of the piles imbedded
in the mud, judging from the implements and other débris scattered
around them, once supported shelters of early man that were erected a few
feet above the water,&mdash;the upper portion of the piles having disappeared
in the long lapse of time that must have ensued since they were placed
there. (The flats are covered by four and one half feet of water on the flood
tide; on the ebb the marsh is dry, and covered with slimy ooze several feet
in depth, varying in different places.) Three different dwellings have been
located, all that exist in the flats referred to, after a careful examination
within the last four years of nearly every inch of ground carefully laid off
and examined in sections. The implements found in two of ‘the supposed
river dwelling sites’ are very rude in type, and generally made of dense argillite,
not unlike the palæoliths found by my friend Dr. C. C. Abbott in the
Trenton gravels. The character of the implements from the other or third
supposed river dwelling on the Delaware marshes is better finished objects
made of argillite.”<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a></p>

<p>The greater portion of the objects obtained by Mr. Cresson has been
placed in the Peabody Museum, to which he is at present attached as a special
assistant; but he has also kindly sent to the writer a small illustrative
collection from each site, for his study.</p>

<p>The writer would hesitate to draw the inference from this single discovery
that the custom of living in pile-dwellings ever prevailed in North
America, although there is evidence that such a practice was not unknown
in South America. This is to be found in the account of the voyage of
Alonso de Ojeda along the north coast of that country, in the year 1499,
in which he was accompanied by Vespucius.<a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> I will quote the language of
Washington Irving: “Proceeding along the coast, he arrived at a vast,
deep gulf resembling a tranquil lake, entering which he beheld on the
eastern side a village whose construction struck him with surprise. It
consisted of twenty large houses, shaped like bells, and built on piles driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
into the bottom of the lake, which in this part was limpid and of but little
depth. Each house was provided with a drawbridge, and with canoes by
which the communication was carried on. From these resemblances to the
Italian city, Ojeda gave to the bay the name of the Gulf of Venice, and it is
called at the present day Venezuela, or Little Venice.”<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> There is no inherent
improbability that such a custom may have prevailed upon the shores
of Delaware Bay, and for the same reason that has caused it to be followed
elsewhere. “It has been stated that the natives living near Lake Maracaybo,
in South America, erect pile dwellings over the lake, to which they resort
in order to escape from the mosquitoes which infest the shore. Lord also
mentions that the Indians of the Suman prairie, British Columbia, on the
subsidence of the annual floods in May and June, build pile dwellings over
a lake there, to which they retire to escape from the mosquitoes which at
that period infest the prairie in dense clouds, but will not cross the
water.”<a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a></p>

<p>But it would be safer, probably, to consider these discoveries of Mr. Cresson’s
as marking the site of ancient aboriginal fish-weirs, such as are described
by Captain Ribault and other early explorers as made by the natives.<a name="FNanchor_1562_1562" id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a>
The writer agrees with Professor Putnam in thinking that “the
fact that at only one station pottery occurs, and, also, that at this station
the stone implements are largely of jasper and quartz, with few of argillite,
while at the two other stations many rude stone implements are associated
with chipped points of argillite, with few of jasper and other flint-like
material, is of great interest.”<a name="FNanchor_1563_1563" id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a></p>

<p>Still further confirmation of the progress of the palæolithic man in this
region is afforded by discoveries made in a rock-shelter near the headwaters
of Naaman’s Creek, as early as 1866, for an account of which, and the
preservation of the objects then found, we are also indebted to Mr. Cresson:
“The remains of the Naaman’s Creek rock-shelter luckily fell into hands
that have preserved them.... To give a detailed account of <i>how</i> the rock-shelter
was discovered would consume too much time. Let us rather consider
briefly the ... contents of the shelter’s various layers.... Fortunately
careful drawings of the shelter were made during its excavation
between the years 1866 and 1867.... A glance shows the outcrop of the
rock as it appeared before the excavations were begun in 1866. The trees
show that the ground was then covered by a thick wood.... From the
point that marks the innermost edge of the outcrop, overhanging the
hollow, a perpendicular line dropped to the ground would measure five and
one eighth feet, the height of the projection of the rock above the ground
before the excavations were commenced.</p>

<p>“Twenty-two feet eight inches from the outcrop, measured from its inner
face, there is still another outcrop.... This marks the opposite side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the hollow.... It is evident how admirably the place was adapted to the
wants of the early hunters of the Delaware valley, whether it be as a
shelter, or as a place of defence against their enemies.... Let us look at
the layers of earth that filled it, these being intermingled with rude implements,
broken bones, and charcoal, indicating that man at times had resorted
to the spot.</p>

<p>“Layer C [the lowest]. This was composed of schist, resting on the bedrock
of the shelter. A layer of aqueous gravel, of the same type as that
underlying Philadelphia, rested on the decomposed schist. The greatest
depth of the red gravel layer was four feet two and one fourth inches,
measured from the layer of decomposed schist. Least depth of gravel observed,
one foot three inches....</p>

<p>“Layer A [next above]. This was a layer of grayish-white brick clay
mixed with yellow clay, similar to that underlying Philadelphia, on top of
which was a layer mixed with sand.... Stone implements were discovered
in this layer. They were but few in number and very rude, exclusively of
argillite, and palæolithic in type. Greatest depth of layer, two feet one and
one half inches. No implements of bone were found....</p>

<p>“Layer T [next above]. This was of reddish gravel, intermingled with
decomposed schist, cinders, and broken bones of animals. Fragments of a
human skull were found ... in this layer. A fragment of a human rib
was also preserved. The fragments of the skull are covered here and there
by dendritic incrustations. Rude spears and implements of argillite were
found in this layer. Depth of layer, thirteen to eighteen inches.</p>

<p>“Layer D [next above]. Composed of reddish-yellow clay. Depth, two
feet three inches. No implements.</p>

<p>“Layer M [next above]. In this layer were numerous implements of
argillite and some of bone, intermingled with rude implements of quartzite
and jasper and fragments of rude pottery, with charcoal. Greatest depth,
one foot one and one half inches. Least depth, three inches.</p>

<p>“Layer R [next above]. Yellow clay. Greatest depth, two feet one and
one half inches; least depth, eight inches. No implements.</p>

<p>“Layer W [next above]. This contained chipped implements; those made
of jasper and quartzite predominating over those of argillite. In the lowest
part of this layer were fragments of rude pottery. In the upper portion of
the layer were potsherds decidedly superior in decoration and technique to
those from the lower portion. Geological composition of this layer, yellow
clay loam. Greatest depth, three feet four inches. Least depth, two and
one half inches.</p>

<p>“Layer L [top]. This consists of leaf mould seven inches thick, converted
into swamp muck by decomposing action of water from springs. No implements....
No remains of extinct animals were found.”<a name="FNanchor_1564_1564" id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a></p>

<p>Professor Putnam thus proceeded to comment upon these discoveries:
“We have a series of objects, taken from the several layers of the shelter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
giving us a chronology of the utmost importance, as each period of occupation
of the shelter was followed by a natural deposition, separating the different
periods of occupation. The stone implements ... are taken from
the lowest layer, indicating the earliest period of occupation of the rock-shelter;
and ... they correspond in shape and rudeness of execution with
those taken from the gravel-bed at Trenton; and like most of the latter
they are all of argillite. The specimens from the second period are of
argillite, and while many are chipped into slender points, they are still of
very rude forms; and these in turn correspond with the argillite points
found by Dr. Abbott deep down in the black soil, or resting upon the
gravel, at Trenton. In the upper layers of the cave we observe ... the
gradual introduction of implements chipped from jasper and quartz, and
corresponding in form with those found upon the surface throughout the
valley. And as a further indication of this later development, it was only
in the upper layers that pottery, bone implements, and ornaments were
found; the three distinct periods of occupation of the Delaware valley are
thus distinctly shown; and this cave-shelter is a perfect exemplification of
the results which Dr. Abbott had obtained from a study of the specimens
which he has collected upon the surface, deep in the black soil, and in the
gravel, at Trenton.”</p>

<p class="p2">From the accumulative force of these various lines of reasoning, the
writer thinks that there is a strong probability that here, on the waters of
the Delaware, man developed from the palæolithic to the neolithic stage of
culture. But we cannot follow Dr. Abbott in his further conclusion (if,
indeed, he still holds to it) that we are to seek the descendants of this
primitive population in the Eskimos, driven north after contact with the
Indians. We have failed to discover the slightest evidence to sustain
this position. The hereditary enmity existing between the Eskimos and
the Indians may be equally well explained upon the theory that the former
are later comers to this continent, and are therefore hated by the Indian
races as intruders. The two races are certainly markedly unlike.</p>

<p>In the absence of any evidence tending to show the development of
the argillite-using people into the Indian races, with their perfected implements
and weapons of the age of polished stone, it seems more reasonable
to hold with Professor Dawkins that the earlier and ruder race perished
before or were absorbed by a people furnished with a better equipment in
the struggle for the “survival of the fittest.” The palæolithic man of the
river gravels of Trenton and his argillite-using posterity the writer believes
to be completely extinct.<a name="FNanchor_1565_1565" id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a></p>

<p>It only remains for the writer to express his regret that he has been prevented
from setting forth in detail, at the present time, the grounds upon
which he has come to other conclusions which were briefly indicated at the
beginning of this chapter. He can only repeat here his belief that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
so-called Indians, with their many divisions into numerous linguistic families,
were later comers to our shores than the primitive population, whose
development he has attempted to trace; that the so-called “moundbuilders”
were the ancestors of tribes found in the occupation of the soil; and that
the Pueblos and the Aztecs were only peoples relatively farther advanced
than the others.</p>

<p>The writer further thinks that these are propositions capable, if not of
being demonstrated, at least of being made to appear in a very high degree
probable by means of authorities which will be found amply referred to in
other chapters of this volume.</p>

AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN IN AMERICA.</a></h3>

<p class="pc1">BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE literature respecting the origin and early condition of the American aborigines is very extensive;
and, as a rule, especially in the earlier period, it is not characterized by much reserve in connecting races by
historical analogies.<a name="FNanchor_1566_1566" id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> Few before Dr. Robertson, in discussing the problem, could say: “I have ventured to
inquire without presuming to decide.”</p>

<p>The question was one that allured many of the earlier Spanish writers like Herrera and Torquemada.
Among the earlier English discussions is that of Wm. Bourne in his <i>Booke called the Treasure for Travellers</i>
(London, 1578), where a section is given to “The Peopling of America.” The most famous of the early
discussions of the various theories was that of Gregorio Garciá, a missionary for twenty years in South
America, who reviewed the question in his <i>Origen de los Indios de el Nuevo Mundo</i> (Valencia, 1607).<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a> He
goes over the supposed navigations of the Phœnicians, the identity of Peru with Solomon’s Ophir, and the
chances of African, Roman, and Jewish migrations,&mdash;only to reject them all, and to favor a coming of Tartars
and Chinese. Clavigero thinks his evidences the merest conjectures. E. Brerewood, in his <i>Enquiries
touching the diversity of languages and religions</i> (London, 1632, 1635), claimed a Tartar origin. In New
England, where many were believers in the Jewish analogies, it is somewhat amusing to find not long after
this the quizzical Thomas Morton, with what seems like mock gravity, finding the aboriginal source in “the
scattered Trojans, after such time as Brutus departed from Latium.”<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> The reader, however, is referred to
other sections of the present volume for the literature bearing upon the distinct ethnical connections of the
early American peoples.</p>

<p>The chief literary controversy over the question began in 1642, when Hugo Grotius published his <i>De
Origine Gentium Americanarum Dissertatio</i> (Paris and Amsterdam, 1642).<a name="FNanchor_1569_1569" id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> He argued that all North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
America except Yucatan (which had an Ethiopian stock) was peopled from the Scandinavian North; that the
Peruvians were from China, and that the Moluccans peopled the regions below Peru. Grotius aroused an
antagonist in Johannes de Laet, whose challenge appeared the next year: <i>Joannis de Laet Antwerpiani
notae ad dissertationem Hugonis Grotii de origine gentium Americanarum: et observationes aliquot ad
meliorem indaginem difficillimæ illius quæstionis</i> (Amsterdam, 1643).<a name="FNanchor_1570_1570" id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> He combated his brother Dutchman
at all points, and contended that the Scythian race furnished the predominant population of America.
The Spaniards went to the Canaries, and thence some of their vessels drifted to Brazil. He is inclined to
accept the story of Madoc’s Welshmen, and think it not unlikely that the people of the Pacific islands may
have floated to the western coast of South America, and that minor migrations may have come from other
lands. He supports his views by comparisons of the Irish, Gallic, Icelandic, Huron, Iroquois, and Mexican
tongues.</p>

<p>To all this Grotius replied in a second <i>Dissertatio</i>, and De Laet again renewed the attack: <i>Ioannis de Laet
Antwerpiani responsio ad dissertationem secundam Hvgonis Grotii, de origine gentium Americanarum.
Cum indice ad utrumque libellum</i> (Amsterdam, 1644).<a name="FNanchor_1571_1571" id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a></p>

<p>De Laet, not content with his own onset, incited another to take part in the controversy, and so George
Horn (Hornius) published his <i>De Originibus Americanis, libri quatuor</i> (Hagæ Comitis, <i>i. e.</i> The Hague,
1652; again, Hemipoli, <i>i. e.</i> Halberstadt, 1669).<a name="FNanchor_1572_1572" id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a> His view was the Scythian one, but he held to later additions
from the Phœnicians and Carthaginians on the Atlantic side, and from the Chinese on the Pacific.</p>

<p>For the next fifty years there were a number of writers on the subject, who are barely names to the present
generation;<a name="FNanchor_1573_1573" id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> but towards the middle of the eighteenth century the question was considered in <i>The American
Traveller</i> (London, 1741), and by Charlevoix in his <i>Nouvelle France</i> (1744). The author of an <i>Enquiry into
the Origin of the Cherokees</i> (Oxford, 1762) makes them the descendants of Meshek, son of Japhet. In 1767,
however, the question was again brought into the range of a learned and disputatious discussion, reviving all
the arguments of Grotius, De Laet, and Horn, when E. Bailli d’Engel published his <i>Essai sur cette question:
Quand et comment l’America a-t-elle été peuplée d’hommes et d’Animaux?</i> (5 vols., Amsterdam, 1767, 2d
ed., 1768). He argues for an antediluvian origin.<a name="FNanchor_1574_1574" id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a> The controversy which now followed was aroused by C. De
Pauw’s characterization of all American products, man, animals, vegetation, as degraded and inferior to
nature in the old world, in an essay which passed through various editions, and was attacked and defended in
turn.<a name="FNanchor_1575_1575" id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a> An Italian, Count Carli, some years later, controverted De Pauw, and using every resource of mythology,
tradition, geology, and astronomy, claimed for the Americans a descent from the Atlantides.<a name="FNanchor_1576_1576" id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
till after reports had come from the Ohio Valley of the extensive earthworks in that region that the question
of the earlier peoples of America attracted much general attention throughout America; and the most conspicuous
spokesman was President Stiles of Yale College, in an address which he delivered before the General
Assembly of Connecticut, in 1783, on the future of the new republic.<a name="FNanchor_1577_1577" id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> In this, while arguing for the unity of
the American tribes and for their affinity with the Tartars, he held to their being in the main the descendants
of the Canaanites expelled by Joshua, whether finding their way hither by the Asiatic route and establishing
the northern Sachemdoms, or coming in Phœnician ships across the Atlantic to settle Mexico and Peru.<a name="FNanchor_1578_1578" id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a>
Lafitau in 1724 (<i>Mœurs de Sauvages</i>) had contended for a Tartar origin. We have examples of the reasoning
of a missionary in the views of the Moravian Loskiel, and of a learned controversialist in the treatise of
Fritsch, in 1794 and 1796 respectively.<a name="FNanchor_1579_1579" id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">BENJAMIN SMITH BARTON</p>
</div></div>

<p>The earliest American with a scientific training to discuss the question was a professor in the University
of Pennsylvania, Benjamin Smith Barton, a man
who acquired one of the best reputations in his
day among Americans for studies in this and other
questions of natural history. His father was an
English clergyman settled in America, and his
mother a sister of David Rittenhouse. It was
while he was a student of medicine in Edinburgh
that he first approached the subject of the origin
of the Americans, in a little treatise on American
Antiquities, which he never completed.<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> His
<i>Papers relating to certain American Antiquities</i>
(Philad., 1796) consists of those read to the Amer.
Philos. Soc., and printed in their <i>Transactions</i>
(vol. iv.). They were published as the earnest of
his later work on American Antiquities. He
argues against De Pauw, and contends that the
Americans are descended&mdash;at least some of them&mdash;from
Asiatic peoples still recognized. The
<i>Papers</i> include a letter from Col. Winthrop Sargent,
Sept. 8, 1794, describing certain articles
found in a mound at Cincinnati, and a letter upon
them from Barton to Dr. Priestley. He in the
end gave more careful attention to the subject,
mainly on its linguistic side, and went farther than
any one had gone before him in his <i>New Views
of the Origin of the Tribes and Nations of America</i> (Philad., 1797; 2d ed., enlarged, 1798).<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> The book
attracted much notice, and engaged the attention in some degree of European philologists, and made Barton
at that time the most conspicuous student on these matters in America. Jefferson was at that time gathering
material in similar studies, but his collections were finally burned in 1801. Barton, in dedicating his
treatise to Jefferson, recognized the latter’s advance in the same direction. He believed his own gathering of
original MS. material to be at that time more extensive than any other student had collected in America.
His views had something of the comprehensiveness of his material, and he could not feel that he could point
to any one special source of the indigenous population.</p>

<p>During the early years of the present century old theories and new were abundant. The powerful intellect
and vast knowledge of Alexander von Humboldt were applied to the problem as he found it in Middle America.
He announced some views on the primitive peoples in 1806, in the <i>Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift</i> (vol.
xv.); but his ripened opinions found record in his <i>Vues de Cordillères et monumens des peuples indigènes de
l’Amérique</i> (Paris, 1816), and the Asiatic theory got a conservative yet definite advocate.</p>

<p>Hugh Williamson<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> thought he found traces of the Hindoo in the higher arts of the Mexicans, and marks of
the ruder Asiatics in the more northern American peoples. A conspicuous littérateur of the day, Samuel L.
Mitchell, veered somewhat wildly about in his notions of a Malay, Tartar, and Scandinavian origin.<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> Meanwhile
something like organized efforts were making. The American Antiquarian Society was formed in
1812.<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> Silliman began his <i>Journal of Arts and Sciences</i> in 1819, and both society and periodical proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
instruments of wider inquiry. In the first volume published by the Antiquarian Society, Caleb Atwater, in
his treatise on the Western Antiquities, gave the earliest sustained study of the subject, and believed in a
general rather than in a particular Asiatic source. The man first to attract attention for his grouping of ascertained
results, unaided by personal explorations, however, was Dr. James H. McCulloh, who published his
<i>Researches on America</i> at Baltimore in 1816. The book passed to a second edition the next year, but received
its final shape in the <i>Researches, philosophical and antiquarian, concerning the aboriginal history of
America</i> (1829), a book which Prescott<a name="FNanchor_1585_1585" id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> praised for its accumulated erudition, and Haven<a name="FNanchor_1586_1586" id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> ranked high for
its manifestations of industry and research, calling it encyclopædic in character. McCulloh examines the
native traditions, but can evolve no satisfactory conclusion from them as to the origin of the Americans.
The public mind, however, was not ripe for scholarly inquiry, and there was not that in McCulloh’s style to
invite attention; and greater popularity followed upon the fanciful and dogmatic confidence of John Haywood,<a name="FNanchor_1587_1587" id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a>
upon the somewhat vivid if unsteady speculations of C. S. Rafinesque,<a name="FNanchor_1588_1588" id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a> and even upon the itinerant
Josiah Priest, who boasted of the circulation of thousands of copies of his popular books.<a name="FNanchor_1589_1589" id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> John Delafield’s
<i>Inquiry into the Origin of the Antiquities of America</i> (N. Y., 1839) revived the theory, never quite dormant,
of the descent of the Mexicans from the riper peoples of Hindostan and Egypt; while the more barbarous
red men came of the Mongol stock. The author ran through the whole range of philology, mythology, and
many of the customs of the races, in reaching this conclusion. A little book by John McIntosh, <i>Discovery
of America and Origin of the North American Indians</i>, published in Toronto, 1836, was reissued in N. Y.
in 1843, and with enlargements in 1846, <i>Origin of the North American Indians</i>, continued down to 1859 to
be repeatedly issued, or to have a seeming success by new dates.<a name="FNanchor_1590_1590" id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a></p>

<p class="p2">When Columbus, approaching the main land of South America, imagined it a large island, he associated it
with that belief so long current in the Old World, which placed the cradle of the race in the Indian Ocean,&mdash;a
belief which in our day has been advocated by Haeckel, Caspari and Winchell,&mdash;and imagined he was on
the coasts, skirting an interior, where lay the Garden of Eden.<a name="FNanchor_1591_1591" id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> No one had then ventured on the belief that
the doctrine of Genesis must be reconciled with any supposed counter-testimony by holding it to be but the
record of the Jewish race. Columbus was not long in his grave when Theophrastus Paracelsus, in 1520, and
before the belief in the continuity of North America with Asia was dispelled, and consequently before the
question of how man and animals could have reached the New World was raised, first broached the heterodox
view of the plurality of the human race. All the early disputants on the question of the origin of the American
man looked either across the Atlantic or the Pacific for the primitive seed; nor was there any necessary
connection between the arguments for an autochthonous American man and a diversity of race, when Fabricius,
in 1721, published his <i>Dissertatio Critica</i><a name="FNanchor_1592_1592" id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> on the opinions of those who held that different races had
been created. From that day the old orthodox interpretation of the record in Genesis found no contestant
of mark till the question came up in relation to the American man, it being held quite sufficient to account
for the inferiority or other distinguishing characteristics of race by assigning them to the influence of climate
and physical causes.<a name="FNanchor_1593_1593" id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a></p>

<p>The strongest presentation of the case, in considering the American man a distinct product of the American
soil, with no connection with the Old World<a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> except in the case of the Eskimos, was made when S. G. Morton,
in 1839, printed his <i>Crania Americana, or a comparative view of the skulls of various aboriginal nations of
North and South America</i>, of which there was a second edition in 1844.<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> Here was a new test, and applied,
very likely, in ignorance of the fact that Governor Pownal, in 1766, in Knox’s <i>New Collection of Voyages</i>, had
suggested it.<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> Dr. Morton had gathered a collection of near a thousand skulls from all parts of the world,<a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a>
and based his deductions on these,&mdash;a process hardly safe, as many of his successors have determined.<a name="FNanchor_1598_1598" id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
The views of Morton respecting the autochthonous origin of the Indian found an able upholder when Louis
Agassiz, taking the broader view of the independent creation of higher and inferior races,<a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> gave in his adhesion
to the original American man (<i>Christian Examiner</i>, July, 1850, vol. xlix. p. 110). These views got more extensive
expression in a publication which appeared in Philadelphia in 1854, in which some unpublished papers of
Morton are accompanied by a contribution from Agassiz, and all are grouped together and augmented by
material of the editors, Dr. Josiah Clark Nott<a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a> of Mobile, and Mr. George R. Gliddon, long a resident in
Cairo. The <i>Types of Mankind, or Ethnological Researches</i> (Philad., 1854, 1859, 1871), met with a divided
reception; the conservative theologians called it pretentious and false, and there was some color for their
detraction in some rather jejune expositions of the Hebrew Scriptures contained in the book. The physiologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
thought it brought new vigor to a question which properly belonged to science.<a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> Other fresh material,
with some discussions, made up a new book by the same editors, published three years later, <i>Indigenous
Races of the Earth, or New Chapters of Ethnological Inquiry</i> (Philad. and London, 1857; 2d ed., 1857).<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a></p>

<p>The theological attacks were not always void of a contempt that ill befitted the work of refutation. The
most important of them were John Bachman’s <i>Doctrine of the Unity of the Human Race</i> (Charleston, S. C.,
1850), with his <i>Notice of the Types of Mankind</i> (Charleston, 1854-55); and Thomas Smyth’s <i>Unity of the
Human Race proved by Scripture, Reason and Science</i> (N. Y., 1850).<a name="FNanchor_1603_1603" id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a></p>

<p>Of the leading historians of the early American peoples, Prescott, dealing with the Mexicans, is inclined
to agree with Humboldt’s arguments as to their primitive connection with Asia.<a name="FNanchor_1607_1607" id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> Geo. Bancroft, in the third
volume of his <i>Hist. of the United States</i> (1840), surveying the field, found little in the linguistic affinities,
little in what Humboldt gathered from the Mexican calendars and from other developments, nothing from
the Western mounds, which he was sure were natural earth-knobs and water-worn passages,<a name="FNanchor_1608_1608" id="FNanchor_1608_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a> and decides upon
some transmission by the Pacific route from Asia, but so remote as to make the American tribes practically
indigenous, so far as their character is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1843 another compiler of existing evidence appeared in Alexander W. Bradford in his <i>American
Antiquities, or Researches into the origin and history of the Red Race</i>. His views were new. He connects
the higher organized life of middle America with the corresponding culture of Southern Asia, the
Polynesian islands probably furnishing the avenue of migrations; while the ruder and more northern peoples
of both shores of the Pacific represent the same stock degraded by northern migrations.</p>

<p>In 1845 the American Ethnological Society began its publications, and in Albert Gallatin it had a vigorous
helper in unravelling some of these mysteries. A few years later (1853) the United States government lent
its patronage and prestige to the huge conglomerate publication of Schoolcraft, his <i>Indian Tribes of the
United States</i>, which leaves the bewildered reader in a puzzling maze,&mdash;the inevitable result of a work undertaken
beyond the ambitious powers of an untrained mind. The work is not without value if the user of it has
more systematic knowledge than its compiler, to select, discard, and arrange, and if he can weigh the importance
of the separate papers.<a name="FNanchor_1609_1609" id="FNanchor_1609_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a></p>

<p>In 1856 Samuel F. Haven, the librarian and guiding spirit of the American Antiquarian Society, summed
up, as it had never been done before, for comprehensiveness, and with a striking prescience, the progress and
results of studies in this field, in his <i>Archæology of the United States</i> (<i>Smithsonian Contributions</i>, viii.,
Washington, 1856).</p>

<p>In 1851 Professor Daniel Wilson, in his <i>Prehistoric Annals of Scotland</i>, first brought into use the designation
“prehistoric” as expressing “the whole period disclosed to us by means of archæological evidence, as
distinguished from what is known through written records; and in this sense the term was speedily adopted
by the archæologists of Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_1610_1610" id="FNanchor_1610_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> Eleven years later he published his <i>Prehistoric Man: Researches into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
origin of civilization in the old and new world</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1611_1611" id="FNanchor_1611_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> The book unfortunately is not well fortified with references,
but it is the result of long study, partly in the field, and written with a commendable reserve of judgment. It
is in the main concerned with the western hemisphere, which he assumes with little hesitation “began its
human period subsequent to that of the old world, and so started later in the race of civilization.” While
thus in effect a study of early man in America, its scope makes it in good degree a complement to the <i>Origin
of Civilization</i> of Lubbock.</p>

<p>The comparative study of ethnological traces, to enable us to depict the earliest condition of human
society, owes a special indebtedness to Edward B. Tylor, among writers in English. It is nearly twenty-five
years since he first published his <i>Researches into the Early History of Mankind and the Development of
Civilization</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1612_1612" id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a> the work almost, if not quite, of a pioneer in this interesting field, and he has supplied the
reader with all the references necessary to test his examples. Max Müller (<i>Chips</i>, ii. 262) has pointed out
how he has vitalized his vast accumulation of facts by coherent classifications instead of leaving them an
oppressive burden by simple aggregation, as his precursors in Germany, Gustav Klemm<a name="FNanchor_1613_1613" id="FNanchor_1613_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a> and Adolf Bastian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
had done; and it is remarked that while thus classifying, he has not been lured into pronounced theory,
which future accession of material might serve to modify or change. He shortly afterwards touched a
phase of the subject which he had not developed in his book in a paper on “Traces of the Early Mental
Condition of Man,”<a name="FNanchor_1614_1614" id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> and illustrated the methods he was pursuing in another on “The Condition of Prehistoric
Races as inferred from observations of modern tribes.”<a name="FNanchor_1615_1615" id="FNanchor_1615_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a></p>

<p>The postulate of which he has been a distinguished expounder, that man has progressed from barbarism to
civilization, was a main deduction to be drawn from his next sustained work, <i>Primitive Culture: researches
into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1616_1616" id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> The chief points of this further
study of the thought, belief, art, and custom of the primitive man had been advanced tentatively in various
other papers beside those already mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_1617_1617" id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> and in this new work he further acknowledges his obligations
to Adolf Bastian’s <i>Mensch in der Geschichte</i> and Theodor Waitz’s <i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1618_1618" id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a> He
still pursued his plan of collecting wide and minute evidence from the writers on ethnography and kindred
sciences, and from historians, travellers, and missionaries, as his foot-notes abundantly testify.</p>

<p>These studies of Professor Tylor abundantly qualified him to give a condensed exposition of the science of
anthropology, which he had done so much to place within the range of scientific studies, by a primary search
for facts and laws; and having contributed the article on that subject to the ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, he published in 1881 his <i>Anthropology: an Introduction to the study of man and civilization</i>
(London and N. Y., 1881 and 1888). He maps out the new science, which has now received of late years
so many new students in the scientific method, without references, but with the authority of a teacher, tracing
what man has been and is under the differences of sex, race, beliefs, habits, and society.<a name="FNanchor_1619_1619" id="FNanchor_1619_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a> Again, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>

<p>Closely following upon Tylor in this field, and gathering his material with much the same assiduity, and
presenting it with similar beliefs, though with enough individuality to mark a distinction, was another Englishman,
who probably shares with Tylor the leading position in this department of study. Sir John Lubbock,
in his <i>Prehistoric Times as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern
savages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1621_1621" id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> gathered the evidence which exists of the primitive condition of man, embracing some chapters on
modern savages so far as they are ignorant of the use of metals, as the best study we can follow, to fill out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the picture of races only archæologically known to us. This study of modern savage life, in arts, marriages,
and relationships, morals, religion, and laws, is, as he holds, a necessary avenue to the knowledge of a condition
of the early man, from which by various influences the race has advanced to what is called civilization.
His result in this comparative study&mdash;not indeed covering all the phases of savage life&mdash;he made known in
his <i>Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1622_1622" id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> While referring to Tylor’s <i>Early Hist.
of Mankind</i> as more nearly like his own than any existing treatise, but showing, as compared with his own
book, “that no two minds would view the subject in the same manner,” he instanced previous treatments of
certain phases of the subject, like Müller’s <i>Geschichte der Amerikanischen Urreligionen</i>, J. F. M’Lennan’s
<i>Primitive Marriage</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1623_1623" id="FNanchor_1623_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a> and J. J. Bachofen’s <i>Das Mutterrecht</i> (Stuttgart, 1861); and even Lord Kames’ <i>History
of Man</i>, and Montesquieu’s <i>Esprit des Lois</i>, notwithstanding the absence in them of much of the minute
knowledge now necessary to the study of the subject. These data, of course, are largely obtained from travellers
and missionaries, and Lubbock complains of their unsatisfactory extent and accuracy. “Travellers,” he
adds, “find it easier to describe the houses, boats, food, dress, weapons, and implements of savages than to
understand their thoughts and feelings.”</p>

<p>The main controversial point arising out of all this study is the one already adverted to,&mdash;whether man has
advanced from savagery to his present condition, or has preserved, with occasional retrogressions, his original
elevated character; and this causes the other question, whether the modern savage is the degenerate descendant
of the same civilized first men. “There is no scientific evidence which would justify us,” says Lubbock (<i>Prehist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Times</i>, 417), “in asserting that this kind of degradation applies to savages in general.”<a name="FNanchor_1624_1624" id="FNanchor_1624_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a> The most distinguished
advocate of the affirmative of this proposition is Richard Whately, Archbishop of Dublin, both in his
<i>Political Economy</i> and in his lecture on the <i>Origin of Civilization</i> (1855), in which he undertook to affirm
that no nation, unaided by a superior race, ever succeeded in raising itself out of savagery, and that nations
can become degraded. Lubbock, who, with Tylor, holds the converse of this proposition, answered Whately in
an appendix to his <i>Origin of Civilization</i>, which was originally given as a paper at the Dundee meeting of
the British Association.<a name="FNanchor_1625_1625" id="FNanchor_1625_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a> The Duke of Argyle, while not prepared to go to the extent of Whately’s views,
attacked, in his <i>Primeval Man</i>, Lubbock’s argument,<a name="FNanchor_1626_1626" id="FNanchor_1626_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> and was in turn reviewed adversely by Lubbock, in a
paper read at the Exeter meeting of the same association (1869), which is also included in the appendix of
his <i>Origin of Civilization</i>. Lubbock seems to show, in some instances at least, that the duke did not possess
himself correctly of some of the views of his opponents.</p>

            <p class="pf400">A sketch map given in Dawson’s <i>Fossil Men</i>, p. 48, showing his view of the probable lines of migration and distribution
of the American tribes. Morgan (<i>Ancient Society</i>) makes what he calls three centres of subsistence, whence the
migration proceeded which overran America. Cf. Hellwald in <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1866, p. 328. The question is more
or less discussed in Latham’s <i>Man and his migrations</i> (London, 1851); Chas. Pickering’s <i>Men and their geog. distribution</i>;
and Oscar Peschel’s <i>Races of Man</i> (Eng. transl., London, 1876). On the passage from the valley of the
Columbia to that of the Missouri, see Humboldt’s <i>Views of Nature</i>, 35. Morgan (<i>No. Am. Rev.</i>, cix.) supposes the
valley of the Columbia River to be the original centre where the streams diverged, and (<i>Systems of Consanguinity</i>,
251) says there are reasons for believing that the Shoshone migration was the last which left the Columbia valley, and
that it was pending at the epoch of European colonization. Morgan’s papers in the <i>No. Am. Rev.</i>, Oct. 1868 and Jan.
1870, are reprinted in Beach’s <i>Indian Miscellany</i>, p. 158. On a general belief in a migration from the north, see <i>Congrès
des Amér</i>. (1877), ii. 50, 51. L. Simonin, in “L’homme Américain, notes d’ethnologie et de linguistique sur les indiens
des Etats-Unis,” gives a map of the tribes of North America in the <i>Bull. de la Soc. de Géog.</i> Feb. 1870.</p>

<p>In the researches of Tylor and Lubbock, and of all the others cited above, the American Indian is the source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of many of their illustrations. Of all writers on this continent, Sir John Wm. Dawson in his <i>Fossil Men</i>, and
Southall in his <i>Recent Origin of Man</i>, are probably the most eminent advocates of the views of Whately
and Argyle, however modified, and both have declared it an unfounded assumption that the primitive man
was a savage.<a name="FNanchor_1627_1627" id="FNanchor_1627_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a> Morgan, in his <i>Ancient Society</i> (N. Y., 1877), has, on the other hand, sketched the lines of
human progress from savagery through barbarism to civilization.</p>

<p>One of the defenders of the supposed Bible limits best equipped by reading, if not in the scientific spirit,
has been a Virginian, James C. Southall, who published a large octavo in 1875, <i>The Recent Origin of Man
as illustrated by geology and the modern science of prehistoric archæology</i> (Philad., 1875). Three years
later,&mdash;leaving out some irrelevant matters as touching the antiquity of man, condensing his collations of
detail, sparing the men of science an attack for what in his earlier volume he called their fickleness, and somewhat
veiling his set purpose of sustaining the Bible record,&mdash;he published a more effective little book, <i>The
Epoch of the Mammoth and the Apparition of Man upon Earth</i> (Philad., 1878). Barring its essentially
controversial character, and waiving judgment on its scientific decisions, it is one of the best condensed
accumulations of data which has been made. His belief in the literal worth of the Bible narrative is emphatic.
He thinks that man, abruptly and fully civilized, appeared in the East, and gave rise to the Egyptian and
Babylonian civilization, while the estrays that wandered westward are known to us by their remains, as the
early savage denizens of Europe. To maintain this existence of the hunter-man of Europe within historic
times, he rejects the prevailing opinions of the geologists and archæologists. He reverses the judgment that
Lyell expresses (<i>Student’s Elements of Geology</i>, Am. ed., 162) of the historical period as not affording any
appreciable measure for calculating the number of centuries necessary to produce so many extinct animals,
to deepen and widen valleys, and to lay so deep stalagmite floors, and says it does. He contends that the
stone age is not divided into the earlier and later periods with an interval, but that the mingling of the
kinds of flints shows but different phases of the same period,<a name="FNanchor_1628_1628" id="FNanchor_1628_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a> and that what others call the palæolithic man
was in reality the quaternary man, with conditions not much different from now.<a name="FNanchor_1629_1629" id="FNanchor_1629_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a> The time when the ice
retreated from the now temperate regions he holds to have been about 2000 b.c., and he looks to the proofs
of the action of which traces are left along the North American great lakes, as observed by Professor Edmund
Andrews<a name="FNanchor_1630_1630" id="FNanchor_1630_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> of Chicago, to confirm his judgment of the Glacial age being from 5,300 to 7,500 years ago.<a name="FNanchor_1631_1631" id="FNanchor_1631_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a>
He claims that force has not been sufficiently recognized as an element in geological action, and that a great
lapse of time was not necessary to effect geological changes (<i>Ep. of the M.</i>, 194).<a name="FNanchor_1632_1632" id="FNanchor_1632_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a> He thinks the present
drift of opinion, carrying back the appearance of man anywhere from 20,000 to 9,000,000 years, a mere
fashion. The gravel of the Somme has been, he holds, a rapid deposit in valleys already formed and not
necessarily old. The peat beds were a deposit from the flood that followed the glacial period, and accumulated
rapidly (<i>Ep. of the M.</i>, ch. 10). The extinct animals found with the tools of man in the caves simply
show that such beasts survived to within historic times, as seems everywhere apparent as regards the mastodon
when found in America. The stalagmites of the caves are of unequal growth, and it is an assumption to
give them uniformly great age. The finely worked flints found among those called palæolithic; the skilfully
free drawings of the cave-men; the bits of pottery discovered with the rude flints, and the great similarity of
the implements to those in use to-day among the Eskimos; the finding of Roman coin in the Danish shell
heaps and an English one in those of America (<i>Proc. Philad. Acad. Nat. Sci.</i>, 1866, p. 291),&mdash;are all parts
of the argument which satisfies him that the archæologists have been hasty and inconclusive in their deductions.
They in turn will dispute both his facts and conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_1633_1633" id="FNanchor_1633_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a></p>

<p>Southall’s arraignment of the opinions generally held may introduce us to a classification of the data
upon which archæologists rely to reach conclusions upon the antiquity of man, and over some of which there
is certainly no prevailing consensus of opinion. We may find a condensed summary of beliefs and data
respecting the antiquity of man in J. P. Maclean’s <i>Manual of the Antiquity of Man</i> (Cincinnati, revised
ed., 1877; again, 1880).<a name="FNanchor_1634_1634" id="FNanchor_1634_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a> The independent view and conservative spirit are placed respectively in juxtaposition
in J. P. Lesley’s <i>Origin and Decline of Man</i> (ch. 3), and in Dawson’s <i>Fossil Men</i> (ch. 8).<a name="FNanchor_1635_1635" id="FNanchor_1635_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a> The
opinions of leading English archæologists are found in Lubbock’s <i>Prehistoric Times</i> (ch. 12), Wallace’s <i>Tropical
Nature</i> (ch. 7), and Huxley’s “Distribution of Races in Relation to the Antiquity of Man,” in <i>Internat.
Cong. of Prehist. Archæol. Trans.</i> (1868). Dawkins has given some recent views in <i>The Nation</i>, xxvi. 434,
and in <i>Kansas City Review</i>, vii. 344.<a name="FNanchor_1636_1636" id="FNanchor_1636_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a> Not to refer to special phases, the French school will be found represented
in Nadaillac’s <i>Les Premiers Hommes</i> (ii. ch. 13); in Gabriel de Mortillet’s <i>La préhistorique antiquité
de l’homme</i> (Paris, 1883); Hamy’s <i>Précis de paléontologie humaine</i>; Le Hon’s <i>L’homme fossile</i> (1867);
Victor Meunier’s <i>Les Ancêtres d’Adam</i> (Paris, 1875); Joly’s <i>L’homme avant métaux</i> (Eng. transl. <i>Man
before Metals</i>, N. Y., 1883); <i>Revue des Questions historiques</i> (vol. xvi.). The German school is represented
in Haeckel’s <i>Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte</i>; Waitz’s <i>Anthropologie</i>; Carl Vogt’s <i>Lectures on Man</i> (Eng.
transl., Lond., 1864); and L. Büchner’s <i>Der Mensch und seine Stellung in der Natur</i> (2d ed., Leipzig, 1872;
or W. S. Dallas’s Eng. translation, Lond., 1872). The history of the growth of geological antagonism to the
biblical record as once understood, and the several methods proposed for reconciling their respective teaching,
is traced concisely in the article on geology in M’Clintock and Strong’s <i>Cyclopædia</i>, with references for further
examination. The views there given are those propounded by Chalmers in 1804, that the geological
record, ignored in the account of Genesis, finds its place in that book between the first and second verses,<a name="FNanchor_1637_1637" id="FNanchor_1637_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a>
which have no dependence on one another, and that the biblical account of creation followed in six literal
days. What may be considered the present theological attitude of churchmen may be noted in <i>The Speaker’s
Commentary</i> (N. Y. ed., 1871, p. 61).</p>

<p class="p2">The question of the territorial connection of America with Asia under earlier geological conditions is
necessarily considered in some of the discussions on the transplanting of the American man from the side
of Asia.</p>

<p>Otto Caspari in his <i>Urgeschichte der Menschheit</i> (Leipzig, 1873), vol. i., gives a map of Asia and America
in the post-tertiary period, as he understands it, which stretches the Asiatic and African continents over a
large part of the Indian Ocean; and in this region, now beneath the sea, he places the home of the primeval
man, and marks the lines of migration east, north, and west. This view is accepted by Winchell in his <i>Preadamites</i>
(see his map). Haeckel (<i>Nat. Schöpfungsgeschichte</i>, 1868, 1873; Eng. transl. 1876) calls this region
“Lemuria” in his map. Caspari places large continental islands between this region and South America,
which rendered migration to South America easy. The eastern shore of the present Asia is extended beyond
the Japanese islands, and similar convenient islands render the passage by other lines of immigration easy
to the regions of British Columbia and of Mexico. (Cf. Short, 507; Baldwin, App.) Howorth, <i>Mammoth and
the Flood</i>, supposes a connection at Behring’s Straits. The supposed similarity of the flora of the two shores
of the Pacific has been used to support this theory, but botanists say that the language of Hooker and Gray
has been given a meaning they did not intend. It is opposed by many eminent geologists. A. R. Wallace
(<i>Journal Amer. Geog. Soc.</i>, xix.) finds no ground to believe that any of the oceans contain sunken continents.
(Cf. his <i>Geographical Distribution of Animals</i> and his <i>Malay Archipelago</i>.) James Croll in his <i>Climate
and Cosmology</i> (p. 6) says: “There is no geological evidence to show that at least since Silurian times the
Atlantic and Pacific were ever in their broad features otherwise than they now are.”<a name="FNanchor_1638_1638" id="FNanchor_1638_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a> Hyde Clarke has

<p class="p2">The arguments for the great antiquity of man<a name="FNanchor_1640_1640" id="FNanchor_1640_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a> are deduced in the main from the testimony of the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
gravels, the bone caves, the peat deposits, the shell heaps, and the Lacustrine villages, for the mounds and
other relics of defence, habitation, and worship are very likely not the records of a great antiquity. The whole
field is surveyed with more fullness than anywhere else, and with a faith in the geological antiquity of the
race, in Sir Charles Lyell’s <i>Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1641_1641" id="FNanchor_1641_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a> With as firm a belief in the
integrity of the biblical record, and in its not being impugned by the discoveries or inductions of science, we
find a survey in Southall’s <i>Recent Origin of Man</i>. These two books constitute the extremes of the methods,
both for and against the conservative interpretation of the Bible. The independent spirit of the scientist is
nowhere more confidently expressed than by J. P. Lesley (<i>Man’s Origin and Destiny</i>, Philad., 1868, p. 45),
who says: “There is no alliance possible between Jewish theology and modern science.... Geologists
have won the right to be Christians without first becoming Jews.” Southall<a name="FNanchor_1642_1642" id="FNanchor_1642_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a> interprets this spirit in this
wise: “I do not recollect that the <i>Antiquity of Man</i> ever recognizes that the book of Genesis is in existence;
and yet every one is perfectly conscious that the author has it in mind, and is writing at it all the time.”<a name="FNanchor_1643_1643" id="FNanchor_1643_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a>
The entire literature of the scientific interpretation shows that the canons of criticism are not yet secure
enough to prevent the widest interpretations and inferences.</p>

<p>The intimations which are supposed to exist in the Bible of a race earlier than Adam have given rise to
what is called the theory of the Preadamites, and there is little noteworthy upon it in European literature
back of Isaac de La Peyrère’s <i>Praeadamitae</i> (Paris and Amsterdam, 1655), whose views were put into English
in <i>Man before Adam</i> (London, 1656).<a name="FNanchor_1644_1644" id="FNanchor_1644_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> The advocates of the theory from that day to this are enumerated
in Alexander Winchell’s <i>Preadamites</i> (Chicago, 1880), and this book is the best known contribution to the
subject by an American author. It is his opinion that the aboriginal American, with the Mongoloids in general,
comes from some descendant of Adam earlier than Noah, and that the black races come from a stock
earlier than Adam, whom Cain found when he went out of his native country.<a name="FNanchor_1645_1645" id="FNanchor_1645_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The investigations of the great antiquity of man in America fall far short in extent of those which have
been given to his geological remoteness in Europe; and yet, should we believe with Winchell that the American
man represents the pre-Adamite, while the European man does not, we might reasonably hope to find in
America earlier traces of the geological man, if, as Agassiz shows, the greater age of the American continent
weighs in the question.<a name="FNanchor_1646_1646" id="FNanchor_1646_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a></p>

<p>The explicit proofs, as advanced by different geologists, to give a great antiquity to the American man, and
perhaps in some ways greater than to the European man,<a name="FNanchor_1647_1647" id="FNanchor_1647_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_1647_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> may now be briefly considered in detail.</p>

<p>Oldest of all may perhaps be placed the gold-drift of California, with its human remains, and chief among
them the Calaveras skull, which is claimed to be of the Pliocene (tertiary) age; but it must be remembered
that Powell and the government geologists call it quaternary. It was in February, 1866, that in a mining
shaft in Calaveras County, California, a hundred and thirty feet below the surface, a skull was found imbedded
in gravel, which under the name of the Calaveras skull has excited much interest. It was not the first time
that human remains had been found in these California gravels, but it was the first discovery that attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
notice. It was not seen <i>in situ</i> by a professional geologist, and a few weeks elapsed before Professor Josiah
Dwight Whitney, then state geologist of California, visited the spot, and satisfied himself that the geological
conditions were such as to make it certain that the skull and the deposition of the gravel were of the same
age. The relic subsequently passed into the possession of Professor Whitney, and the annexed cut is reproduced
from the careful drawing made of it for the <i>Memoirs of the Museum of Comp. Zoölogy</i> (Harvard
University), vol. vi. He had published earlier an account in the <i>Revue d’Anthropologie</i> (1872), p. 760.<a name="FNanchor_1648_1648" id="FNanchor_1648_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_1648_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a>
This interesting relic is now in Cambridge, coated with thin wax for preservation, but this coating interferes
with any satisfactory photograph. The volume of <i>Memoirs</i> above named is made up of Whitney’s
<i>Auriferous Gravels of the Sierra Nevada of California</i> (1880), and at p. ix he says: “There will undoubtedly
be much hesitancy on the part of anthropologists and others in accepting the results regarding the
Tertiary Age of man, to which our investigations seem so clearly to point.” He says that those who reject
the evidence of the Calaveras skull because it was not seen <i>in situ</i> by a scientific observer forget the evidence
of the fossil itself; and he adds that since 1866 the other evidence for tertiary man has so accumulated
that “it would not be materially weakened by dropping that furnished by the Calaveras skull itself.”</p>

<p>What Whitney says of the history and authenticity of the skull will be found in his paper on “Human
remains and works of art of the gravel series,” in <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 258-288. His conclusions are that it shows the
existence of man with an extinct fauna and flora, and under geographical and physical conditions differing
from the present,&mdash;in the Pliocene age certainly. This opinion has obtained the support of Marsh and Le
Conte and other eminent geologists. Schmidt (<i>Archiv für Anthropologie</i>) thinks it signifies a pre-glacial
man. Winchell (<i>Preadamites</i>, 428) says it is the best authenticated evidence of Pliocene man yet adduced.
On the contrary, there are some confident doubters. Dawkins (<i>No. Am. Rev.</i>, Oct., 1883) thinks that all but
a few American geologists have given up the Pliocene man, and that the chances of later interments, of accidents,
of ancient mines, and the presence of skulls of mustang ponies (introduced by the Spaniards) found
in the same gravels, throw insuperable doubts. “Neither in the new world nor the old world,” he says,
“is there any trace of Pliocene man revealed by modern discovery.” Southall and all the Bible advocates of
course deny the bearing of all such evidence. Dawson (<i>Fossil Men</i>, 345) thinks the arguments of Whitney
inconclusive. Nadaillac (<i>L’Amérique préhistorique</i>, 40, with a cut, and his <i>Les Premiers Hommes</i>, ii. 435)
hesitates to accept the evidence, and enumerates the doubters.<a name="FNanchor_1649_1649" id="FNanchor_1649_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Footprints have been found in a tufa bed, resting on yellow sand, in the neighborhood of an extinct volcano,
Tizcapa, in Nicaragua. One of the prints is shown in the annexed cut, after a representation given by
Dr. Brinton in the <i>Amer. Philosoph. Soc. Proc.</i> (xxiv. 1887, p. 437). Above this tufa bed were fourteen
distinct strata of deposits before the surface soil was reached. Geologists have placed this yellow sand,
bearing shells, from the post-Pliocene to the Eocene. The seventh stratum, going downwards, had remains of
the mastodon.<a name="FNanchor_1650_1650" id="FNanchor_1650_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Foster rather strikingly likens what we know of the history of the human race to the apex of a pyramid, of
which we know neither the height nor extent of base. Our efforts to trace man back to his beginning would
be like following down the sides of that pyramid till it reaches a firm base, we know not where. Many geologists
believe in a great ice-sheet which at one time had settled upon the northern parts of America, and
covered it down to a line that extends across Pennsylvania, Ohio, and westerly in a direction of some variableness.
There are some, like Sir William Dawson,<a name="FNanchor_1651_1651" id="FNanchor_1651_1651"></a><a href="#Footnote_1651_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a> who reject the evidence that persuades others. Prof.
Whitney (<i>Climatic Changes</i>, 387) holds that it was a local phenomenon confined in America to the northeastern
parts. The advocates look to Dr. James Geikie<a name="FNanchor_1652_1652" id="FNanchor_1652_1652"></a><a href="#Footnote_1652_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a> as having correlated the proofs of the proposition as
well as any, while writers like Howorth<a name="FNanchor_1653_1653" id="FNanchor_1653_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_1653_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a> trace the resulting phenomena largely to a flood.</p>

one extreme to the other.<a name="FNanchor_1656_1656" id="FNanchor_1656_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_1656_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a></p>

<p>Others believe that we must look back 200,000 years, as James Croll<a name="FNanchor_1657_1657" id="FNanchor_1657_1657"></a><a href="#Footnote_1657_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a> and Lubbock do, or 800,000 and more,
as Lyell did at first, and find the cause in the variable eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, which shall account
for all the climatic changes since the dawn of what is called the glacial epoch, accompanying the deflection
of ocean currents, as Croll supposes, or the variations in the disposition of sea and land, as Lyell imagines.<a name="FNanchor_1658_1658" id="FNanchor_1658_1658"></a><a href="#Footnote_1658_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a>
This great ice-sheet, however extensive, began for some reason to retreat, at a period as remote, according as
we accept this or the other estimate, as from ten thousand to a hundred thousand years.</p>

<p class="p2">That the objects of stone, shaped and polished, which had been observed all over the civilized world, were

<p>In the gravels which were deposited by the melting of this more or less extended ice-sheet, parts of the

            <p class="pf400">The outer outline is that of the skull found in the cave of Cro-magnon, in France, belonging, as Dawson says, p. 189,
to one of the oldest human inhabitants of western Europe, as shown in Lartet and Christy’s <i>Reliquiae Aquitanicae</i>.
The second outline is that of the Enghis skull; the dotted outline that of the Neanderthal skull. The shaded skull is on
a smaller scale, but preserving the true outline, and is one of the Hochelaga Indians (site of Montreal). Cuts of the Enghis
and Neanderthal skulls are given in Lubbock’s <i>Prehistoric Times</i>, pp. 328, 329. Dawkins (<i>Cave Hunters</i>, 235) thinks
the Enghis skull of doubtful age. On the Neanderthal skull see Quatrefages and Hamy, <i>Crania Ethnica</i> (Paris,
1873-75), and Dawkins (p. 240). Huxley gives it a great antiquity, and says it is the most ape-like one he ever saw.
Quatrefages, <i>Hommes fossiles</i>, etc. (1884), says it is not below some later men. Southall (<i>Epoch of the Mammoth</i>, 80)
says it has the average capacity of the negro, and double that of the gorilla, and doubts its antiquity.</p>

<p>It was in the <i>American Naturalist</i> (Mar. and Ap., 1872) that Dr. C. C. Abbott made an early communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
respecting the discovery of rude human implements in the glacial gravels<a name="FNanchor_1663_1663" id="FNanchor_1663_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_1663_1663" class="fnanchor">[1663]</a> of the Delaware valley, and
since then the Trenton gravels have been the subject of much interest. The rudeness of the flints has
repeatedly raised doubts as to their artificial character; but Wilson (<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. 29) says that it is
impossible to find in flints broken for the road, or in any other accumulation of rocky débris, a single specimen
that looks like the rudest implement of the drift. Experts attest the exact correspondence of these Trenton
tools with those of the European river drift. Abbott has explained the artificial cleavages of stone in the
<i>American Antiquarian</i> (viii. 43). There are geologists like Shaler who question the artificial character of
the Trenton implements. From time to time since this early announcement, Dr. Abbott has made public
additional evidence as he has accumulated it, going to show, as he thinks, that we have in these deposits of the
glacial action the signs of men contemporary with the glacial flow, and earlier than the red Indian stock of historic
times.<a name="FNanchor_1664_1664" id="FNanchor_1664_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_1664_1664" class="fnanchor">[1664]</a> He summarizes the matter in his “Palæolithic implements of a people on the Atlantic coast

<p class="p2">Some discoveries of human bones in the loess or loam of the Mississippi Valley have not been generally
accepted. Lyell (<i>Second Visit</i>, ii. 197; <i>Antiq. of Man</i>, 203) suspends judgment, as does Joseph Leidy in
his <i>Extinct Mammalia of North America</i> (p. 365).</p>

<p class="p2">The existence of man in western Europe with extinct animals is a belief that, from the incredulity which
accompanied the discovery by Kemp in London, in 1714, of a stone hatchet lying in contiguity to some
elephant’s teeth,<a name="FNanchor_1666_1666" id="FNanchor_1666_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a> has long passed into indisputable fact, settled by the exploration of cave and shell heaps.<a name="FNanchor_1667_1667" id="FNanchor_1667_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a>
In North America, this conjunction of man’s remains with those of the mastodon is very widely spread.<a name="FNanchor_1668_1668" id="FNanchor_1668_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1668_1668" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
geological evidence is quite sufficient without resorting to what has been called an Elephant’s head in the
architecture of Palenqué, the so-called Elephant Mound in Wisconsin, and the dubious if not fraudulent Elephant
Pipe of Iowa.<a name="FNanchor_1669_1669" id="FNanchor_1669_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_1669_1669" class="fnanchor">[1669]</a> The positions of the skeletons have led many to believe that the interval since the
mastodon ceased to roam in the Mississippi Valley is not geologically great. Shaler (<i>Amer. Naturalist</i>, iv.
162) places it at a few thousand years, and there is enough ground for it perhaps to justify Southall (<i>Recent
Origin, etc.</i>, 551; <i>Ep. of the Mammoth</i>, ch. 8) in claiming that these animals have lived into historic times.</p>

<p class="p2">A human skeleton was found sixteen feet below the surface, near New Orleans&mdash;(which is only nine feet
above the Gulf of Mexico), and under four successive growths of cypress forests. Its antiquity, however, is
questioned.<a name="FNanchor_1670_1670" id="FNanchor_1670_1670"></a><a href="#Footnote_1670_1670" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a> The belief in human traces in the calcareous conglomerate of Florida seems to have been based
(Haven, p. 87) on a misconception of Count Pourtalès’ statement (<i>Amer. Naturalist</i>, ii. 434), though it has
got credence in many of the leading books on this subject. Col. Whittlesey has reported some not very ancient
hearths in the Ohio Valley (<i>Am. Ass. Arts and Sciences, Proc., Chicago, 1868, Meeting</i>, vol. xvii. 268).</p>

<p class="p2">The testimony of the caves to the early existence of man has never had the importance in America that it
has had in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in 1822 that Dr. Buckland, in his <i>Reliquiae diluvianae</i> (2d ed., 1824), first made something like a
systematic gathering of the evidence of animal remains, as shown by cave explorations; but he was not prepared
to believe that man’s remains were as old as the beasts. He later came to believe in the prehistoric
man. In 1833-34, Dr. Schmerling found in the cave of Enghis, near Liége, a highly developed skull, and published
his <i>Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles découverts dans les cavernes de la province de Liége</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1671_1671" id="FNanchor_1671_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_1671_1671" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a></p>

<p>In 1841, Boucher de Perthes began his discoveries in the valley of the Somme,<a name="FNanchor_1672_1672" id="FNanchor_1672_1672"></a><a href="#Footnote_1672_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a> and finally discovered
among the animal remains some flint implements, and formulated his views of the great antiquity of man in
his <i>Antiquités Celtiques</i> (1847), rather for the derision than for the delectation of his brother geologists. In
1848, the Société Ethnographique de Paris ceased its sessions; but Boucher de Perthes had aroused a new
feeling, and while his efforts were still in doubt his disciples<a name="FNanchor_1673_1673" id="FNanchor_1673_1673"></a><a href="#Footnote_1673_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> gathered, and amid much ridicule founded the
Société d’Anthropologie de Paris, which has had so numerous a following in allied associations in Europe and
America.</p>

<p>He tells us of the struggles he endured to secure the recognition of his views in his <i>De l’homme antédiluvien
et de ses œuvres</i> (Paris, 1860), and his trials were not over when, in 1863, he found at Moulin Quignon a
human jaw-bone,<a name="FNanchor_1674_1674" id="FNanchor_1674_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_1674_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a> which, as he felt, added much strength to the belief in the man of the glacial gravels.<a name="FNanchor_1675_1675" id="FNanchor_1675_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The existence of man in the somewhat later period of the caves<a name="FNanchor_1676_1676" id="FNanchor_1676_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a> was also claiming constant recognition,
and the new society was broad enough to cover all. In 1857, Dr. Fuhlrott had discovered the Neanderthal
skull in a cave near Düsseldorf.</p>

<p>In 1858, the discovery of flint tools in the Brixham cave, in Devonshire, was more effective in turning the
scientific mind to the proofs than earlier discoveries of much the same character by McEnery had been. In
March, 1872, Emile Rivière investigated the Mentone caves, and found a large skeleton, unmistakably human,
and the oldest yet found, supposed to be of the palæolithic period. (Cf. <i>Découverte d’un Squelette humain
de l’Epoque paléolithique</i>, Paris, 1873.) All this evidence is best set forth in the collection of his periodical
studies on the mammals of the Pleistocene, which were collected by William Boyd Dawkins in his <i>Cave Hunting:
researches on the evidence of caves, respecting the early inhabitants of Europe</i> (London, 1874),<a name="FNanchor_1677_1677" id="FNanchor_1677_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a> a book
which may be considered a sort of complement to Lyell’s <i>Antiquity of Man</i> and Lubbock’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i>;
Dawkins (ch. 9, and <i>Address</i>, Salford, 1877, p. 3) and Lubbock (<i>Scientific Lectures</i>, 150) unite in holding
the modern Eskimos to be the representative of this cave folk. No argument is quite sufficient to convince
Southall that the archæologists do not place the denizens of the caves too far back (<i>Recent Origin of Man</i>,
ch. 13), and he rejects a belief in the steady slowness of the formation of stalagmites (<i>Epoch of the Mammoth</i>,
90), upon which Evans, Geikie, Wallace, Lyell, and others rest much of their belief in the great antiquity of
the remains found beneath the cave deposits.<a name="FNanchor_1678_1678" id="FNanchor_1678_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a></p>

<p>The largest development of cave testimony in America has been made by Dr. Lund,<a name="FNanchor_1679_1679" id="FNanchor_1679_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a> a Danish naturalist,
who examined several hundred Brazilian caves, finding in them the bones of man in connection with those of
extinct animals.<a name="FNanchor_1680_1680" id="FNanchor_1680_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_1680_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a> The remains of a race, held to be Indians, found in the caves of Coahuila (Mexico) are
described by Cordelia A. Studley in the <i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>, xv. 233. Edward D. Cope has studied the
contents of a bone cave in the island of Anguilla (West Indies), in the <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge</i>,
no. 489 (1883). J. D. Whitney describes a cave in Calaveras County, in the <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i> (1887),
and Edward Palmer one in Utah (<i>Peab. Mus. Rept.</i>, xi. 269). Putnam explored some in Kentucky (<i>Ibid.</i>
viii.). Putnam’s first account of his cave work in Kentucky, showing the use of them as habitations and as
receptacles for mummies, is in the <i>Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist.</i>, xvii. 319. J. P. Goodnow made similar explorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>

the <i>Am. Philos. Soc. Trans.</i> (1880) xv. 351. Col. Charles Whittlesey has discussed the “Evidences of the
antiquity of man in the United States,” in describing some cave remains of doubtful age.<a name="FNanchor_1681_1681" id="FNanchor_1681_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1681_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a> W. H. Dall’s <i>On

<p class="p2">Throughout the world, naturalists have found on streams and on the seacoast, heaps of the refuse of the
daily life of primitive peoples. Beneath the loam which has covered them there are found the shells of
edible mollusks and other relics of food, implements, ornaments and vessels, of stone, clay, and bone. Sometimes
it happens that natural superposed accumulations will mark them off in layers, and distinguish the
usages of successive periods.<a name="FNanchor_1682_1682" id="FNanchor_1682_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_1682_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a></p>

<p>In the Old World such heaps upon the Danish coast have attracted the most attention under the name of

<p>These accumulations are known usually in America as shell heaps, and it is generally characteristic of them
that, while they contain pottery and bone implements, the stone instruments are far less numerous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
generally occur in the upper layers in those of Florida, but they are scattered through all the layers in those
of New England. Professor Jeffries Wyman, whose name is in this country particularly associated with
shell-heap investigations, could not find<a name="FNanchor_1684_1684" id="FNanchor_1684_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_1684_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> that any one had in the scientific spirit called attention to the
subject in America earlier than Caleb Atwater in the <i>Archæologia Americana</i> (vol. i., 1820), who had observed
such deposits on the Muskingum River in Ohio. They had not passed unnoticed, however, by some of the
early explorers. Putnam (<i>Essex Inst. Bulletin</i>, xv. 86) notes that J. T. Ducatel observed those on the Chesapeake
in 1834. The earliest more particular mention of the inland mounds seem to have been made in
Prinz Maximilian’s <i>Travels in the United States</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1685_1685" id="FNanchor_1685_1685"></a><a href="#Footnote_1685_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a> Foster, in his <i>Prehistoric Races of the U. S.</i> (ch. 4,&mdash;a

ends in the Delaware River, and has shown that two of these river stations are earlier than the third, as is
evident from the rude implements of argillite found in the two when compared with those discovered in the
third, where implements of jasper and quartz and fragments of pottery were associated with those of argillite.</p>

<p>The earliest discoveries of the cliff houses of the Colorado region were made by Lieut. J. H. Simpson, and
his descriptions appeared in his <i>Journal of a Military Reconnoissance</i>, in 1849.<a name="FNanchor_1688_1688" id="FNanchor_1688_1688"></a><a href="#Footnote_1688_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a> No considerable addition
was made to our knowledge of the cliff dwellers till in 1874-75, when special parties of the Hayden Geological
Survey were sent to explore them (<i>Hayden’s Report</i>, 1876), whence we got accounts of those of southwestern
Colorado by W. H. Holmes, including the cavate-houses and cliff-dwellers of the San Juan, the Mancos, and
the ruins in the McElmo cañon.<a name="FNanchor_1689_1689" id="FNanchor_1689_1689"></a><a href="#Footnote_1689_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a> W. H. Jackson gives a revised account of his 1874 expedition in the <i>Bulletin</i>

as perhaps is the better opinion. Their connection with savage nations farther north is not wholly
determinable, as Morgan allows, on physical and social grounds, and perhaps not as definitely settled by their

New channels of information were opened when the United States government undertook to make surveys
(1853) for a trans-continental line of railways; and a great deal of material is embodied in Whipple’s report on
the Indian tribes in the <i>Pacific R. R. Reports</i>, vol. iii. The running of the boundary line between the United
States and Mexico also contributed to our knowledge. The commissioner during 1850-53 was John Russell
Bartlett, who, on the failure of the government promptly to publish his report, printed his <i>Personal narrative
of explorations and incidents</i> (N. Y., 1854), and made in some parts of it an important contribution to
our knowledge of the antiquities of this region.<a name="FNanchor_1704_1704" id="FNanchor_1704_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_1704_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a></p>

<p>No considerable advance was now made in this study for about a score of years. Major Powell first published
his account of his adventurous exploration (1869) of the Colorado cañon in <i>Scribner’s Monthly</i> (Jan.,
Feb., Mar.) in 1875, and it was followed by his official <i>Exploration of the Colorado River</i> (Washington,
1875), making known the existence of ruins in the cañon’s gloomy depths. The <i>Reports</i> of the U. S. Geological
Survey, including the accounts by W. H. Jackson and W. H. Holmes, give much valuable and original
information; and a good deal of what has been included in the <i>Reports of the Chief of Engineers</i> (U. S. Army)
for 1875 and 1876 will also be found in the seventh volume, edited by F. W. Putnam, of <i>Wheeler’s Survey</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1705_1705" id="FNanchor_1705_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a>
including the pueblos of Acoma, Taos, San Juan, and the ruin<a name="FNanchor_1706_1706" id="FNanchor_1706_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_1706_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a> on the Animas River.</p>

<p>The latest examinations of these Pueblo remains, of which we have published accounts, are those made by
A. F. Bandelier for the Archæological Institute of America. He has given his results in his “Historical
introduction to studies among the sedentary Indians of New Mexico,” and in his “Report on the ruins of
Pecos,” which constitutes the initial volume of <i>Papers, American series</i>, of the Institute (Boston, 1881).<a name="FNanchor_1707_1707" id="FNanchor_1707_1707"></a><a href="#Footnote_1707_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a> He
believes Pecos to be Cicuye, visited by Alvarado in 1541,&mdash;a huge pile with 585 compartments, finally
abandoned in 1840. In October, 1880, he examined the region west of Santa Fé (<i>Second Rept. Archæol.
Inst.</i>). His explorations also determined the eastern limits of the sedentary occupation of New Mexico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
(<i>Fifth Report</i>). He renewed his studies in 1882 (<i>First Bull. Archæol. Inst.</i>, Jan., 1883), and thought the
ruins showed successive occupiers, and divides them into cave dwellings, cliff houses, one-story buildings, and
those of more than one, with each higher one retreating from the front of the next lower.</p>

<p>The most essential sources of information have thus been enumerated, but there is not a little fugitive and
comprehensive treatment of the subject worth the student’s attention who follows a course of investigation.<a name="FNanchor_1708_1708" id="FNanchor_1708_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_1708_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The literature of the moundbuilders, and of the controversies arising out of the mysterious relics of their
life, is commensurate with the very wide extent of territory covered by their traces.<a name="FNanchor_1709_1709" id="FNanchor_1709_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_1709_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a> It was long before any
intelligent notice was taken of the mounds by those who traversed the wilderness. De Soto, in 1540,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
could get no traditions concerning them beyond the assurances that the peoples he encountered had built
them, or some of them. We read of them also in Garcilasso de la Vega, Biedma and the Knight of Elvas, on
the Spanish side; but on the French at a later day we learn little or nothing from Joutel, Tonti, and Hennepin,
though something from Du Pratz, La Harpe and some of the missionaries. Kalm,<a name="FNanchor_1710_1710" id="FNanchor_1710_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_1710_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a> the Swede, in 1749, was
about the first to make any note of them. Carver found them near Lake Pepin in 1768. In 1772 the missionary
David Jones<a name="FNanchor_1711_1711" id="FNanchor_1711_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a> made observations upon those in Ohio. Adair did not wholly overlook them in his
<i>American Indians</i> in 1775. Prof. James Dunbar, of Aberdeen, in his <i>Essays on the history of mankind in
rude and uncultivated ages</i> (Lond., 1780), uses what little Kalm and Carver afforded. Jefferson in his <i>Notes
on Virginia</i> (1782) speaks of them as barrows “all over the country,” and “obvious repositories of the
dead.”<a name="FNanchor_1712_1712" id="FNanchor_1712_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_1712_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a> Arthur Lee makes reference to them in 1784. A map of the Northwest Territory, published by
John Fitch about 1785, places in the territory which is now Wisconsin the following legend: “This country
has once been settled by a people more expert in the art of war than the present inhabitants. Regular fortifications,
and some of these incredibly large, are frequently to be found. Also many graves and towers like
pyramids of earth.” In 1786 Franklin thought the works at Marietta might have been built by De Soto;
and Noah Webster, in a paper in Roberts’ <i>Florida</i>, assented.<a name="FNanchor_1713_1713" id="FNanchor_1713_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_1713_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a> B. S. Barton, in his <i>Observations in some
parts of Natural History</i> (London, 1787), credited the Toltecs with building them, whom he considered
the descendants of the Danes.</p>

<p>As the century draws to a close, we find occasional and rather bewildered expression of interest in the
<i>Observations on the Ancient Mounds</i> by Major Jonathan Heart;<a name="FNanchor_1714_1714" id="FNanchor_1714_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_1714_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a> in the <i>Missions</i> of Loskiel; in the <i>New
Views</i> of Dr. Smith Barton; in the <i>Carolina</i> of William Bartram; and in the travels of Volney. In 1794
Winthrop Sargent reported in the <i>Amer. Philos. Soc. Trans.</i>, iv., on the exploration of the mounds at Cincinnati.
The present century soon elicited a variety of observations, but there was little of practical exploration.
A New England minister, Thaddeus Mason Harris, passed judgment upon those in Ohio, when he
journeyed thither in 1803.<a name="FNanchor_1715_1715" id="FNanchor_1715_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a> The commissioner of the United States to run the Florida boundary, Andrew
Ellicott, describes some near Natchez in his <i>Journal</i> (1803). Bishop Madison communicated through Professor
Barton some opinions about those in Western Virginia, which appear in the <i>Transaction</i> of the
American Philosophical Society, taking different grounds from Dr. Harris, who had thought them works of
defence. The explorations of Lewis and Clark (1804-6) up the Missouri, and of Pike (1805-7) up the Mississippi,
produced little. Robin, the French naturalist, in 1805,<a name="FNanchor_1716_1716" id="FNanchor_1716_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a> Major Stoddard<a name="FNanchor_1717_1717" id="FNanchor_1717_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_1717_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a> and Breckenridge<a name="FNanchor_1718_1718" id="FNanchor_1718_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718_1718" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a> later,
saw some in Louisiana, Missouri, and Illinois. A leading periodical, <i>The Portfolio</i>, contributed something
to the common stock in 1810 and 1814, giving plans of some of the mounds. Those in Ohio were again the
subject of inquiry by F. Cuming in his <i>Sketches of a Tour to the Western Country</i> (Pittsburg, 1810), and by
Dr. Daniel Drake in his <i>Picture of Cincinnati and the Miami Valley</i> (Cinn., 1815). John Heckewelder, the
Moravian missionary, accounted for the ancient fortifications through the traditions of the Delawares, who
professed once to have inhabited this country, but it has been suspected that the worthy missionary was imposed
upon.<a name="FNanchor_1719_1719" id="FNanchor_1719_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a> DeWitt Clinton, in 1811, before the New York Historical Society, and again in 1817, before
the Literary and Philosophical Society of New York, had given some theories in which the Scandinavians
figured as builders of the mounds in that State.</p>

<p>It was thus at a time when there was much speculation and not much real experimental knowledge respecting
these remains that, under the auspices of the then newly founded American Antiquarian Society, Mr. Caleb
Atwater, of Ohio, was employed to explore and survey a considerable number of these works. He embodied
his results in the initial volume of the publication of that society, the <i>Archæologia Americana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1720_1720" id="FNanchor_1720_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a> After
pointing out scattered evidences of the traces of European peoples, found in coins and other relics throughout
the country, Atwater proceeds to his description of the earthworks, mainly of Ohio; and beside giving many
plans,<a name="FNanchor_1721_1721" id="FNanchor_1721_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a> he enters into the question of their origin, and expresses a belief in the Asiatic origin of their builders,
and in their subsequent migration south to lay, as he thinks, the foundations of the Mexican and Peruvian
civilizations.</p>

<p>During the next twenty-five years there cannot be said to have been much added to a real knowledge of the
subject. Yates and Moulton in their <i>Hist. New York</i> (1824) borrowed mainly from Kirkland (1788) the missionary.
Humboldt had no personal contact with the remains to give his views any value (1825). Warden
in his <i>Recherches</i> (1827) gave some new plans and rearranged the old descriptions. There was some sober
observation in M’Culloh’s <i>Researches</i> (3d ed., 1829); some far from sober in Rafinesque (1838); some compiled
descriptions with worthless comment in Josiah Priest’s <i>American Antiquities</i> (Albany, 1838); something
like scientific deductions in S. G. Morton’s study of the few moundbuilders’ skulls then known, in his
<i>Cranea Americana</i> (1839); with an attempt at summing up in Delafield (1839) and Bradford (1841). This
is about all that had been added to what Atwater did, when E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis eclipsed all labors
preceding theirs, and began the series of the <i>Smithsonian Contributions</i> with their <i>Ancient Monuments of
the Mississippi Valley</i> (Washington, 1847 and 1848).<a name="FNanchor_1722_1722" id="FNanchor_1722_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a> During the preceding two years they had opened over
two hundred mounds, and explored about a hundred earthwork enclosures, and had gathered a considerable
collection of specimens of moundbuilders’ relics.<a name="FNanchor_1723_1723" id="FNanchor_1723_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a> They had begun their work under the auspices of the
American Ethnological Society, but the cost of the production of the volume exceeded the society’s resources,
and the transfer was made to the Smithsonian Institution. The work took a commanding position at once,
and still remains of essential value, though some of the grounds of its authors are not acceptable to present
observers; and indeed in his work on the mounds of New York, which the Smithsonian Institution included
in the second volume of their <i>Contributions</i>, Squier found occasion to alter some of his opinions in his
earlier work, or at least to ascribe the mounds of that State to the Iroquois. The third volume of the same
<i>Contributions</i> (1852) introduces to us one of the ablest of the local investigators in a paper by Charles Whittlesey,
of “Descriptions of Ancient Works in Ohio,”&mdash;the forerunner of numerous papers which he has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>

Contributions</i>, a new field in the emblematic and animal mounds of the northwest was for the first
time brought to any considerable extent to public
attention in the paper by Increase A. Lapham,
on the “Antiquities of Wisconsin.” Lapham had
made his explorations under the auspices of the
American Antiquarian Society,<a name="FNanchor_1725_1725" id="FNanchor_1725_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a> and his manuscript

<p>The animal mounds had been indeed earlier mentioned,
and the great serpent mound of Ohio had
long attracted attention; but it was in the territory
now known as Wisconsin that these mounds were
found chiefly to abound. Long, in 1823, speaks of
mounds in this region; but the forest coverings seem
to have prevented any observer detecting their
shapes till Lapham first noted this peculiarity in
1836. In April, 1838, R. C. Taylor was the earliest
to figure them in the <i>Amer. Journal of Science</i>
(Silliman’s), and again they were described by S.
Taylor in <i>Ibid.</i>, 1842. Prof. John Locke referred
to them in a <i>Report on the mineral lands of the
United States</i>, made to Congress in 1844. William
Pidgeon, who had been a trader among the Indians,
published in his <i>Traditions of De-coo-dah, and
Antiquarian researches: comprising extensive exploration,
surveys and excavations of the Mound
Builders in America; the traditions of the last
Prophet of the Elk Nation, relative to their origin
and use, and the evidences of an ancient population more numerous than the present Aborigines</i> (N. Y.,
1853; again 1858) what he pretended was in large part the results of his intercourse with an Indian chief, involving
some theories as to the symbolism of the mounds. The book contained so many palpable perversions,
not to say undisguised fictions, that the Smithsonian Institution refused to publish it;<a name="FNanchor_1726_1726" id="FNanchor_1726_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a> and the book
has never gained any credit, though some unguarded writers have unwittingly borrowed from it.<a name="FNanchor_1727_1727" id="FNanchor_1727_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a></p>

<p>In the eighth volume of the <i>Smithsonian Contributions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1728_1728" id="FNanchor_1728_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a> Haven, the librarian of the Amer. Antiq. Soc.,
summed up the results of mound exploration as they then stood. The steady and circumspect habit of
Haven’s mind was conspicuous in his treatment of the mounds. It is to him that the later advocates of the
identity of their builders with the race of the red Indians look as the first sensibly to affect public opinion in
the matter.<a name="FNanchor_1729_1729" id="FNanchor_1729_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a> He argued against their being a more advanced race (p. 154), and in his <i>Report</i> of the Am.
Antiq. Soc., in 1877 (p. 37), he held that it might yet be proved that the moundbuilders and red Indians
were one in race, as M’Culloh had already suggested.</p>

<p>At the time when Haven was first intimating (1856) that this view might yet become accepted, it was
doubtless held to be best established that those who built the mounds were quite another race from those
who lived among them when Europeans first knew the country. The fact that the Indians had no tradition of
their origin was held to be almost conclusive, though it is alleged that the southern Indians in later times
retained no recollections of the expedition of De Soto, and Dr. Brinton thinks that it is common for Indian
traditions to die out.<a name="FNanchor_1730_1730" id="FNanchor_1730_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> It is not till recent years that any considerable number of moundbuilder skulls have
been known, and from the scant data which the early craniologists had, their opinion seems to have coincided
with those in favor of a vanished race.<a name="FNanchor_1731_1731" id="FNanchor_1731_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a> It was a favorite theory, not yet wholly departed, that they were in
some way connected with the more southern peoples, the Pueblo Indians, the Aztecs, or the Peruvians; either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
that they came from them, or migrated south and became one with them.<a name="FNanchor_1732_1732" id="FNanchor_1732_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a> The bolder theory, that we see
their descendants in the red Indians, is perhaps gaining ground, and it has had the support of the Bureau of

            <p class="pf400">This follows a survey given in Squier’s <i>Serpent Symbol</i> (N. Y., 1851), p. 137. It is criticised by Putnam in
<i>Peabody Museum Reports</i>, xviii. 348, and <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Oct., 1883. Putnam has recently purchased over
sixty acres about the effigy, which is to be held by the trustees of the Peabody Museum as a park (<i>Repts.</i>, xxi. 14);
and his recent explorations show that the projections in the side of the head (shaded dark in the cut) are not a part of
the construction. He also finds two distinct periods of occupation in this region, to the oldest of which he attributes
this work (<i>Peab. Mus. Rept.</i> 1888). W. H. Holmes made a survey in 1886 (<i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, May, 1887, ix. 141;
<i>Science</i>, viii. 624, Dec. 31, 1886). Cf. J. P. MacLean, in <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, vii. 44, and his <i>Moundbuilders</i>, p. 56;
Baldwin’s <i>Anc. America</i>, 29. T. H. Lewis describes a snake mound in Minnesota (<i>Science</i>, ix. 393). On the serpent
symbol see S. D. Peet, in <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, viii. 197; ix. 13, where he manifests a somewhat omnivorous appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the opposing theory of a disappeared race, Capt. Heart in reply to Barton (<i>Amer. Philolog. Asso. Proc.</i>
iii.) gave, as Thomas thinks, “the earliest clear and distinct expression,” but Squier and Davis may be considered
as first giving it definite meaning; and though Squier does not seem to have actually revoked this judgment
as respects the mounds in the Mississippi valley, he finally reached the conclusion that those in New
York were really the work of the Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_1734_1734" id="FNanchor_1734_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a> This ancient-race theory, sometimes amounting to a belief in
their autochthonous origin, has impressed the public through some of the best known summaries of American
antiquities, like those of Baldwin, Wilson, and Short,<a name="FNanchor_1735_1735" id="FNanchor_1735_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a> and has been adopted by men of such reputation
as Lyell.<a name="FNanchor_1736_1736" id="FNanchor_1736_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_1736_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> The position taken by Professor F. W. Putnam, the curator of the Peabody Museum of Archæology
at Cambridge, is much like that taken earlier by Warden in his <i>Recherches</i>, that both views are, within
their own limitations, correct, and, as Putnam expresses it, “that many Indian tribes built mounds and earthworks
is beyond doubt; but that all the mounds and earthworks of North America are by these same tribes,
or their immediate ancestors, is not thereby proved.”<a name="FNanchor_1737_1737" id="FNanchor_1737_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> Thomas (<i>Fifth Report, Bureau Ethnol.</i>) holds this
statement to be too vague. It is certainly shown in the whole history of archæological study that uncompromising
demarcations have sooner or later to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Morgan finds it difficult to dissociate the mounds with his favorite theory of communal life.<a name="FNanchor_1738_1738" id="FNanchor_1738_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_1738_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a> There is no
readier way of marking the development of opinion on this question than to follow the series of the <i>Annual
Reports</i> of the Smithsonian Institution, as hardly a year has passed since 1861 but these <i>Reports</i> have had in
them contributions on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_1739_1739" id="FNanchor_1739_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a> Among periodicals, the more constant attention to the mounds is
conspicuous in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1740_1740" id="FNanchor_1740_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>The basis for estimating the age of the mounds is threefold. In the first place, there are very few found on
the last of the river terraces to be reclaimed from the stream. In the second place, the decay of the skeletons
found in them can be taken as of some indication, if due regard be had to the kind of earth in which they
are buried. Third, the age of trees upon them has been accepted as carrying them back a certain period, at
least, though this may widely vary, if you assume their growth to be subsequent to the abandonment of the
mounds, or if, as Brinton holds,<a name="FNanchor_1741_1741" id="FNanchor_1741_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a> the trees were planted immediately upon the building. The dependence
upon counting the rings is by no means a settled opinion as to all climes; but in the temperate zone the best
authorities place dependence upon it. Unfortunately it cannot carry us back much over 600 years.<a name="FNanchor_1742_1742" id="FNanchor_1742_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The early attempts to disclose the ethnological relations of the moundbuilders on cranial evidence were
embarrassed by the fewness of the skulls then known. Morton (<i>Crania Americana</i>) called the four examined
by him identical with those of the red Indian.<a name="FNanchor_1743_1743" id="FNanchor_1743_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a> At present, considerable numbers are available; but still
Wilson (<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, ii. 128) holds that “we lack sufficient data,” and in the consideration of them
sufficient care has not always been taken to distinguish intrusive burials of a later date.<a name="FNanchor_1744_1744" id="FNanchor_1744_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a></p>

<p>J. W. Foster (<i>Prehist. Races</i>, ch. 8; <i>Amer. Assoc. Adv. Sci. Trans.</i>, 1872; and <i>Amer. Naturalist</i>, vi. 738)
held to a lower type of skull, on this evidence, than Wilson (<i>Prehist. Man</i>, ii. ch. 20) contended for. There
are examples of the wide difference of views (MacLean, 142), when some, like Morgan, connect them with
the Pueblo skulls (<i>No. Amer. Rev.</i>, cix., Oct., 1869), and others, like Morton, Winchell, Wilson, Brasseur,
and Foster, find their correspondences in those of Mexico and Peru.<a name="FNanchor_1745_1745" id="FNanchor_1745_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a> Putnam, whose experience with mound
skulls is greatest of all, holds to the southern short head and the northern long head (<i>Rept.</i> 1888). Probably
we have no better enumeration of the variety of objects and relics found in the mounds, though much has
since been added to the collection, than in Rau’s <i>Catalogue of the Archæological Collection of the National
Museum</i> (Washington, 1876).<a name="FNanchor_1746_1746" id="FNanchor_1746_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a> Unfortunately he shows little or no discrimination between discoveries in
the mounds and those of the surface. The interest in such collections has naturally brought prominently to
the attention of every student of such collections the tricks of fraudulent imitators, and there are several well-known
instances of protracted controversies on the genuineness of certain relics.<a name="FNanchor_1747_1747" id="FNanchor_1747_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_1747_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>There remains in this survey of the literature of the mounds in all their varieties, to go over it, finally, in
relation to their geographical distribution:<a name="FNanchor_1748_1748" id="FNanchor_1748_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>New England is almost destitute of these antiquities. The one that has attracted some attention is what
is described as a fortification in Sanbornton, in New Hampshire, which when found was faced with stone

<p>As we move westward, the mounds begin to be numerous in the State of New York, and particularly in the
western part of it. One of the earliest descriptions of them, after that of the missionary Kirkland (about
1788), is in the “Journal of the Rev. John Taylor while on a mission through the Mohawk and Black River
Country in 1802,” which was first printed, with plans of the works examined, in the <i>Documentary Hist. New
York</i> (vol. iii. quarto ed.). In 1818 DeWitt Clinton published at Albany his <i>Memoir on the Antiquities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the western part of New York</i>, in which he attributes their origin to the Scandinavians.<a name="FNanchor_1750_1750" id="FNanchor_1750_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a> They were again
described in David Thomas’s <i>Travels through the western country in 1816</i> (Auburn, 1819). There is not
much else to note for twenty-five years. In 1845, Schoolcraft made to the N. Y. Senate his <i>Report on the
Census of the Iroquois Indians</i> (Albany and N. Y., 1846, 1847, 1848), which is better known, perhaps, in the
trade edition, <i>Notes on the Iroquois; or Contributions to the Statistics, Aboriginal History, Antiquities and
General Ethnology of Western New York</i> (N. Y. 1846). In 1850, the <i>Third Report</i> of the Regents of the
University of the State of N. Y. contains F. B. Hough’s paper on the earthwork enclosures in the State, with
cuts. The same year (1850) came the essential authority on the New York mounds, E. G. Squier’s <i>Aboriginal
Monuments of the State of N. Y., comprising the results of original surveys and explorations, with an
illustrative appendix</i> (Washington, 1850), which the next year made part of the second volume of the <i>Smithsonian
Contributions</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1751_1751" id="FNanchor_1751_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a> He enumerates in New York about 250 defensive structures, beside burial mounds

was seemingly the earliest traveller to note them in <i>Journal of a Tour</i>, where he gives one of the earliest
engravings. A plan of those at Circleville, with description by J. Kilbourne, is given in the <i>Ohio Gazetteer</i>
(Columbus, 1817). Caleb Atwater, in 1820, was more familiar with them than with others of his broader field.
Warden in his <i>Recherches</i> noted the early describers. Gen. Harrison discussed the mounds in his <i>Discourse
on the Aborigines of the Valley of the Ohio</i> (Cincinnati, 1838). Squier and Davis, of course, brought them
within their range,<a name="FNanchor_1757_1757" id="FNanchor_1757_1757"></a><a href="#Footnote_1757_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a> and Col. Whittlesey supplemented their work in the third volume of the <i>Smithsonian
Contributions</i>. Whittlesey and Matthew C. Read contributed the Report on the Archæology of Ohio, which
forms the second portion of the <i>Final Report of the Ohio State Board of Centennial Managers</i> (Columbus,
1877), and in it is a list of the ancient enclosures, which is not, as Short says (p. 82), as complete as it should
be. A survey of the mounds was made by E. B. Andrews, and published in the <i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> (no.
x.), 1877. The Ohio State Archæological and Historical Society started in June, 1887, the <i>Ohio archæological
and historical Quarterly</i>, which has vigorously entered the field, and in it (March, 1888) G. F. Wright
has reported on the present condition of the mounds. M. C. Read’s <i>Archæology of Ohio</i> (Cleveland, 1888)
was published by the Western Reserve Historical Society, whose series of Tracts is of importance for the
study of the mounds.<a name="FNanchor_1758_1758" id="FNanchor_1758_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_1758_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a> Henry A. Shepard’s <i>Antiquities of the State of Ohio</i> (Cincinnati, 1887) summarizes

whites; but by an Indian race driven south, of whom he finds the modern representatives in the Cherokees.</p>

<p>Of all the works in the central portions of Ohio, and indeed of all in any region, those at Newark, in Licking

<p>Wisconsin is the central region of what are known as the animal, effigy, symbolic, or emblematic mounds.
Mention has been made elsewhere of the earliest notices of this kind of earthwork. The most extensive
examination of them is the <i>Antiquities of Wisconsin as surveyed and described by I. A. Lapham</i> (Washington,

<p>When Lewis and Clark explored the Missouri River in 1804-6, they discovered mounds in different parts of
its valley; but their statements were not altogether confirmed till the parties of the United States surveyors
traversed the region after the civil war, as is particularly shown in Hayden’s <i>Geological Survey, 6th Rept.</i>,
in 1872. Within the present State of Missouri the mounds which have attracted most notice are those near

<p>Out of all this discussion has risen the new science of Anthropology, broad enough in its scope to include
not only archæology in its general acceptation, but to sweep into its range of observation various aspects of
ethnology and of geology. It is a new science as at present formulated; but under other conditions it is
traced from its origin with the ancients in a paper by T. Bendyshe in the <i>Memoirs of the Anthropological
Society of London</i> (vol. i. 335). Its progress in America is treated by O. T. Mason in the <i>American Naturalist</i>
(xiv. 348; xv. 616). The most approved methods of modern research are explained in Emil
Schmidt’s <i>Anthropologische Methoden; Anleitung zum beobachten und sammeln für Laboratorium und
Reise</i> (Leipzig, 1888). “The methods of archæological investigation are as trustworthy as those of any
natural science,” says Lubbock (<i>Scientific Lectures</i>, 139). Beside the publications of the various Archæological,
Anthropological, and Ethnological Societies and Congresses<a name="FNanchor_1799_1799" id="FNanchor_1799_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_1799_1799" class="fnanchor">[1799]</a> of both hemispheres, we find for Europe

<p>The principal comprehensive works covering the prehistoric period in North America, are J. T. Short’s
<i>North Americans of Antiquity</i> (N. Y., 1879, and later); the <i>L’Amérique préhistorique</i> of Nadaillac (Paris,
1883);<a name="FNanchor_1805_1805" id="FNanchor_1805_1805"></a><a href="#Footnote_1805_1805" class="fnanchor">[1805]</a> Foster’s <i>Prehistoric Races of the United States</i> (Chicago, 1873; 6th ed., 1887); and the compact
popular <i>Ancient America</i> (N. Y., 1871) of John D. Baldwin. Beside Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i>, there are various
treatises of confined nominal scope, but covering in some degree the whole North American field, which
are noted in other pages.<a name="FNanchor_1806_1806" id="FNanchor_1806_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_1806_1806" class="fnanchor">[1806]</a></p>

<p>The purely ethnological aspects of the American side of the subject are summarily surveyed in A. H. Keane’s
“Ethnology of America,” appended to Stanford’s <i>Compendium of Geography, Cent. America</i>, etc. (London,
2nd ed., 1882), and there are papers on Ethnographical Collections in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i> (1862).<a name="FNanchor_1807_1807" id="FNanchor_1807_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_1807_1807" class="fnanchor">[1807]</a> The
great repository of material, however, is in the <i>Contributions to North American Ethnology</i>, being a section
of Major Powell’s <i>Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region</i>, and in the <i>Annual Reports</i> of the Bureau of
Ethnology since 1879, made under Major Powell’s directions, and in the <i>Reports of the Peabody Museum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1808_1808" id="FNanchor_1808_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_1808_1808" class="fnanchor">[1808]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> student will find a general survey of “Les Sources de l’histoire anté-Colombienne du nouveau monde,
par Léon de Rosny,” in the <i>Revue Orientale et Américaine</i> (<i>Mém. de la soc. d’ethnographie</i>) <i>session de
1877</i> (p. 139). Bancroft in his <i>Native Races</i> (v. 136) makes a similar grouping of the classes of sources
relating to the primitive Americans.<a name="FNanchor_1809_1809" id="FNanchor_1809_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_1809_1809" class="fnanchor">[1809]</a> These classes are defined in Daniel G. Brinton’s <i>Review of the data for
the study of the prehistoric chronology of America</i> (Salem, 1887), from the <i>Proceedings of the Amer. Asso.
for the Advancement of Science</i> (vol. xxxvi.), as conveniently divided into groups pertaining to legendary,
monumental, industrial, linguistic, physical, and geological phenomena.</p>

<p>There have been given in the Introduction of the present volume the titles of general bibliographies of
American histories, most of which include more or less of the titles pertaining to aboriginal times. It is the
purpose of the present brief essay to enumerate, in an approximately chronological order, the titles of some
of those and of others which are useful to the archæologist. So far as they are of service to the student of
the American languages, an extended list will be found prefixed to Pilling’s <i>Proof-Sheets</i> (p. xi).</p>

<p>The earliest American bibliography was that of Antonio de Leon, usually called Pinelo,&mdash;<i>Epitome de la
Biblioteca oriental y occidental náutica y Geográfica</i> (Madrid, 1629),&mdash;but which is usually found in the edition
of Gonzales de Barcía, “Añadido y enmendado nuevamente” (Paris, 1737-1738), in which the American
titles, including numerous manuscripts, are given in the second volume.<a name="FNanchor_1810_1810" id="FNanchor_1810_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_1810_1810" class="fnanchor">[1810]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Bibliotheca Hispana Nova</i> of Nicolás Antonio was first published at Rome in 1672, but in a second
edition at Madrid in 1783-88.<a name="FNanchor_1811_1811" id="FNanchor_1811_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_1811_1811" class="fnanchor">[1811]</a></p>

<p>Passing by the <i>Bibliotheca Mexicana</i> of Eguiara y Eguren,<a name="FNanchor_1812_1812" id="FNanchor_1812_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_1812_1812" class="fnanchor">[1812]</a> and the early edition of Beristain, we note the
new edition of the latter, prepared not by Juan Evangelista Guadalajara, as Brasseur notes,<a name="FNanchor_1813_1813" id="FNanchor_1813_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1813_1813" class="fnanchor">[1813]</a> but by another, as
the title shows,&mdash;<i>Biblioteca Hispano-Americana Septentrional, ó catalogo y noticia de los Literatos que ó
nacidos, ó educados, ó florecientes en la America Septentrional Española, han dado á luz algun escrito ó lo
han dexado preparado para la prensa por José Mariano Beristain y Martin de Souza. Segunda edicion,
por Fortino Hipólito Vera</i> (Amecameca, 1883).</p>

<p>Dr. Robertson intimates that the lists of books which writers of the seventeenth century had been in the
habit of prefixing to their books as evidence of their industry had come to be regarded as an ostentatious expression
of their learning, and with some hesitancy he counted out to the reader his 717 titles; but Clavigero,
as elsewhere pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_1814_1814" id="FNanchor_1814_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_1814_1814" class="fnanchor">[1814]</a> was richer in such resources. Humboldt, in his <i>Vues</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1815_1815" id="FNanchor_1815_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_1815_1815" class="fnanchor">[1815]</a> gives a list of the authors
which he cites.</p>

<p>The class of dealers’ catalogues&mdash;we cite only such as have decided bibliographical value&mdash;begins to be
conspicuous in Paul Trömel’s <i>Bibliothèque Américaine</i> (Leipzig, 1861), the best of the German ones, and in
Charles Leclerc’s <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i> (Paris, 1867), much improved in his <i>Bibliotheca Americana. Histoire,
géographie, voyages, archéologie et linguistique des deux Amériques et des îles Philippines</i> (Paris, 1878),
with later supplements, constituting the best of the French catalogues, provided with an excellent index and
a linguistic table, rendered necessary by the classified plan of the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>The list formed by students in this field begins with the <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i> of Harrisse
(New York, 1866; additions, Paris, 1872), and includes the <i>Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne, précédée d’un
coup d’œil sur les études américaines dans leurs rapports avec les études classiques, et suivie du tableau,
par ordre alphabétique, des ouvrages de linguistique Américaine contenus dans le même volume</i> (Paris,
1871) of the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, who at that time had been twenty-five years engaged in the studies
and travels which led to the gathering of his collection. The library, almost entire, was later joined to that of
Alphonse L. Pinart, and was included in the latter’s <i>Catalogue de livres rares et précieux, manuscrits et
imprimés</i> (Paris, 1883).</p>

<p>In 1866, Icazbalceta published at Mexico his <i>Apuntes para un Catálogo de Escritores en lenguas indígenas
de América</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1816_1816" id="FNanchor_1816_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_1816_1816" class="fnanchor">[1816]</a> but of his great bibliographical work only one volume has as yet appeared: <i>Bibliografía Américana
del Siglo xvi. Primera parte</i>. <i>Catálogo razonado de libros impresos en México de 1539 à 1600, con
biografías de autores y otras ilustraciones, precedido de una noticia acerca de la introducción de la imprenta
en México</i> (México, 1886).</p>

<p>Bandelier has embodied some of the results of his study in his “Notes on the Bibliography of Yucatan and
Central America,” in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, n. s., i. pp. 82-118.</p>

<p>The catalogues of collections having special reference to aboriginal America are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Catalogue de la Bibliothèque de José Maria Andrade, 7,000 pièces et volumes, ayant rapport au Méxique
ou imprimés dans ce pays</i> (Leipzig, 1869).<a name="FNanchor_1817_1817" id="FNanchor_1817_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_1817_1817" class="fnanchor">[1817]</a></p>

<p><i>Bibliotheca Mejicana</i>: <i>Books and manuscripts almost wholly relating to the history and literature of
North and South America, particularly Mexico</i> (London, 1869). This collection was formed by Augustin
Fischer, chaplain to the Emperor Maximilian; but there were added to the catalogue some titles from the collection
of Dr. C. H. Berendt.</p>

<p><i>Catalogue of the library of E. G. Squier, edited by Joseph Sabin</i> (N. Y., 1876).</p>

<p><i>Bibliotheca Mexicana, or A Catalogue of the library of the rare books and important MSS. relating to
Mexico and other parts of Spanish America, formed by the late Señor Don José Fernando Ramirez</i> (London,
1880). This catalogue was edited by the Abbé Fischer.<a name="FNanchor_1818_1818" id="FNanchor_1818_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_1818_1818" class="fnanchor">[1818]</a></p>

<p>The most useful guides to the literature of aboriginal America, however, are some compiled in this country.
First, the comprehensive though not yet complete bibliography, Joseph Sabin’s <i>Dictionary of books relating
to America</i>, now being continued since Sabin’s death, and with much skill, by Wilberforce Eames. Second,
the voluminous <i>Proof-sheets of a Bibliography of the languages of the North American Indians</i> (Washington,
1885), prepared by James Constantine Pilling, tentatively, in a large quarto volume, distributed only to collaborators,
and out of which, with emendations and additions, he is now publishing special sections of it, of
which have already appeared those relating to the Eskimo and Siouan tongues. His enumeration so much
exceeds the range of purely linguistic monographs that the treatises become in effect general bibliographies of
aboriginal America.</p>

<p>Third, <i>An Essay towards an Indian bibliography, being a Catalogue of books relating to the history, antiquities,
languages, customs, religion, wars, literature and origin of the American Indians, in the library
of Thos. W. Field, with bibliographical and historical notes and synopses of the contents of some of the
works least known</i> (N. Y., 1873). The sale of Mr. Field’s library took place in New York, May, 1875, from a
Catalogue not so elaborate, but still of use. These books are not so accurately compiled as to be wholly trustworthy
as final resorts.</p>

<p>Finally, the list prefixed to Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i>, vol. i., and the references of his foot-notes, throughout
his five volumes (condensed often in Short’s <i>North Americans of Antiquity</i>), are on the whole the most serviceable
aids to the general student, but unfortunately the index of the set is of no use in searching for bibliographical
detail.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that the bibliographies of sectional or partial import in the field of American
archæology are referred to elsewhere in the present volume.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">THE COMPREHENSIVE TREATISES ON AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>By the Editor.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> the time when Bancroft published his <i>Native Races</i> (1875), he referred to John D. Baldwin’s <i>Ancient
America</i> (N. Y., 1871) as the only preceding, comprehensive book on America before the Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_1819_1819" id="FNanchor_1819_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_1819_1819" class="fnanchor">[1819]</a> It still
remains a convenient book of small compass; but its absence of references to sources precludes its usefulness
for purposes of study, and it is not altogether abreast of the latest views. To the popular element a moderate
share of the indexical character, rendering the book passably serviceable to the average reader, has been
added in the somewhat larger <i>North Americans of Antiquity, their origin, migrations, and type of civilization
considered, by John T. Short</i> (N. Y., 1880,&mdash;somewhat improved in later editions), though it will be
observed that the Peruvian and other South American antiquities have not come within his plan. The
latest of these comprehensive books is the Marquis de Nadaillac’s (Jean F. A. du Pouget’s) <i>L’Amérique
préhistorique</i> (Paris, 1883), which in an English version by N. D’Anvers was published with the author’s
sanction in London in 1882. With revision and some modifications by W. H. Dall, which have not met the
author’s sanction, it was republished as <i>Prehistoric America</i> (N. Y., 1884). It is a work of more theoretical
tendency than the student wishes to find at the opening stage of his inquiry.</p>

<p>But as a compend of every department of archæological knowledge up to about fifteen years ago no advance
has yet been made upon Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i> as indicative of every channel of investigation which the student
can pursue. Upon the monuments of the moundbuilders (iv. ch. 13) and the antiquities of Peru (iv. ch.
14) the treatment is condensed and without references, as occupying a field beyond his primary purpose of
covering the Pacific slope of North America and the immediately adjacent regions. Mention is made elsewhere
of Bancroft’s methods of compilation, and it may suffice to say that in the five volumes of his <i>Native
Races</i> he has drawn and condensed his matter from the writings of about 1200 writers, whose titles he gives
in a preliminary list.<a name="FNanchor_1820_1820" id="FNanchor_1820_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1820_1820" class="fnanchor">[1820]</a> The method of arranging the departments of the work is perhaps too far geographical
to be always satisfactory to the special student,<a name="FNanchor_1821_1821" id="FNanchor_1821_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_1821_1821" class="fnanchor">[1821]</a> and he seems to be aware of it (for instance, i. ch. 2);
but it may be questioned if, while writing with, or engrafting upon, an encyclopædic system, what might pass
for a continuous narrative, any more scientific plan would have been more successful. Bancroft’s opinions
are not always as satisfactory as his material. The student who uses the <i>Native Races</i> for its groups and
references will accordingly find a complemental service in Sir Daniel Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i> (London,
1876), in which the Toronto professor conducts his “researches into the origin of civilization in the old and
the new world,” by primarily treating of the early American man, as the readiest way of understanding early
man in Europe. His system is to connect man’s development topically in the directions induced by his
habits, industries, dwellings, art, records, migrations, and physical characterizations.</p>

<p>Another and older book, in some respects embodying like purposes, and though produced at a time when
archæological studies were much less advanced than at present, is Alexander W. Bradford’s <i>American Antiquities
and researches into the origin and history of the red race</i> (N. Y., 1841).<a name="FNanchor_1822_1822" id="FNanchor_1822_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_1822_1822" class="fnanchor">[1822]</a> The first section of the
book is strictly a record of results; but in the final portion the author indulges more in speculative inquiry.
Even in this he has not transcended the bounds of legitimate hypothesis, though some of his postulates will
hardly be accepted nowadays, as when he contends that the red Indians are the degraded descendants of the
people who were connected with the so-called civilization of Central America.<a name="FNanchor_1823_1823" id="FNanchor_1823_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1823_1823" class="fnanchor">[1823]</a></p>

<p>The periodical literature of a comprehensive sort is not so
extensive as treatments of special aspects; but the student
will find Poole’s <i>Index</i> and Rhee’s <i>Catalogue and Index
of the Smithsonian publications</i> serviceable.</p>

THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>By the Editor.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">While</span> we have a moderate list of works on the general subject of prehistoric art and industries,<a name="FNanchor_1824_1824" id="FNanchor_1824_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_1824_1824" class="fnanchor">[1824]</a> we lack
any comprehensive survey of the subject as respects the American continent, and must depend on sectional and
local treatment. Humboldt in the introduction to his <i>Atlas</i> of his <i>Essai politique</i> (Paris, 1813) was among
the earliest to grasp the material which illustrates the origin and first progress of the arts in America. The
arts of the southern regions and western coasts of North America are best followed in those portions of the
chapters on the Wild Tribes, devoted to the subject, which make up the first volume of Bancroft’s <i>Native
Races</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1825_1825" id="FNanchor_1825_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_1825_1825" class="fnanchor">[1825]</a> and for Mexican and Maya productions some chapters (ch. 15, 24) in the second volume. Prescott’s
treatment of the more advanced peoples of this region is scant (<i>Mexico</i>, i., introd., ch. 5). The art in stone of
the Pueblo Indians is beautifully illustrated in Putnam’s portion of Wheeler’s <i>Report</i> of his survey, and comparison
may be made with Hayden’s <i>Annual Rept.</i> (1876) of the U. S. Geol. and Geographical Survey. The
work of Putnam and his collaborators in the archæological volume (vii.) of Wheeler’s <i>Survey</i> is probably
the most complete account of the implements, ornaments and utensils of any one people (those of Southern
California) yet produced; and its illustrations have not been surpassed. Passing north, we shall get some
help from E. L. Berthoud’s paper on the “Prehistoric human art from Wyoming and Colorado,” in his
“Journal of a reconnaissance in Creek Valley, Col.,” published by the Colorado Acad. of Nat. Sciences (<i>Proceedings</i>,
1872, p. 46). In the <i>Pacific Rail Road Reports</i> (vol. iii. in 1856) there is a paper by Thomas
Ewbank in “Illustrations of Indian antiquities and arts.” S. S. Haldeman has described the relics of human
industry found in a rock shelter in southeastern Pennsylvania (<i>Compte Rendu, Cong. des Amér.</i>, Luxembourg,
ii. 319; and <i>Transactions Amer. Philos. Soc.</i>, 1878). The best of all the more comprehensive monographs
is Charles C. Abbott’s <i>Primitive industry: or illustrations of the handiwork, in stone, bone and clay, of the
native races of the Northern Atlantic seaboard of America</i> (Salem, 1881). Morgan’s <i>League of the Iroquois</i>
touches in some measure of the arts of that confederacy, his earliest study being in the <i>Fifth Report of the
Regents of the State of New York</i> (1852).</p>

<p>For the Canada regions, the <i>Annual Reports of the Canadian Institute</i>, appended to the <i>Reports</i> of the
Minister of Education, Ontario, contain accounts of the discovery of objects of stone, horn, and shell. (See
particularly the sessions of 1886-87.) Dawson in his <i>Fossil men</i> (ch. 6) considers what he accounts the lost
arts of the primitive races of North America. On the other hand, Professor Leidy found still in use among
the present Shoshones split pebbles resembling the rudest stone implements of the palæolithic period (<i>U. S.
Geological Survey</i>, 1872, p. 652).</p>

<p>Many archæologists have remarked on the uniform character of many prehistoric implements, wherever
found, as precluding their being held as ethnical evidences. The system of quarrying<a name="FNanchor_1826_1826" id="FNanchor_1826_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_1826_1826" class="fnanchor">[1826]</a> for flint best fitted for
the tool-maker’s art has been observed by Wilson (<i>Prehistoric man</i>, i. 68) both in the old and new world, and
in his third chapter (vol. i.) we have a treatise on the ancient stone-worker’s art.<a name="FNanchor_1827_1827" id="FNanchor_1827_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1827_1827" class="fnanchor">[1827]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>Treating the subject topically, we find the late Charles Rau making some special studies of the implements
used in native agriculture<a name="FNanchor_1828_1828" id="FNanchor_1828_1828"></a><a href="#Footnote_1828_1828" class="fnanchor">[1828]</a> in the <i>Smithsonian Reports</i> for 1863, 1868, and 1869.<a name="FNanchor_1829_1829" id="FNanchor_1829_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_1829_1829" class="fnanchor">[1829]</a> The agriculture of the
Aztecs and Mayas is treated in Max Steffen’s <i>Die Landwirtschaft bei den altamerikanischen Kulturvölkern</i>
(Leipzig, 1883).<a name="FNanchor_1830_1830" id="FNanchor_1830_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_1830_1830" class="fnanchor">[1830]</a></p>

<p>The working of flint or obsidian into arrowpoints or cutting implements is a process by pressure that has
not been wholly lost. Old workshops, or the chips of them, have been discovered, and they are found in
numerous localities (Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. 75, 79; Abbott’s <i>Primitive Industry</i>, and Putnam in the
<i>Bull. Essex Institute</i>), but Powell in his <i>Report of Explorations of the Colorado of the West</i> (1873) does not,
as Wilson says he does, describe the present ways.<a name="FNanchor_1831_1831" id="FNanchor_1831_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1831_1831" class="fnanchor">[1831]</a></p>

<p>Wilson (<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. ch. 4 and 7) in an essay on the bone and ivory workers substitutes for the corresponding
words usually employed in classifying stone implements the terms palæotechnic and neotechnic,
as indicating periods of progress, in order that the art of making tools in horn, bone, shell, and ivory might
have a better recognition, as of equal importance with that of making such in stone. Separate treatises are
few. Morgan has a paper on the bone implements of the Arickarees in the <i>21st Rept. of the Regents of the
University of the State of N. Y.</i> (1871), and Rau’s monograph on <i>Prehistoric fishing in Europe and North
America, one of the Smithsonian Contributions</i> (1884), involves the making of fish-hooks of bone. See also
Putnam in the <i>Peabody Museum Reports</i>, and in <i>Wheeler’s Survey</i>, vol. vii.; Wyman’s contributions on the
shell heaps, and the <i>Journal of the Cincinnati Soc. of Nat. Hist</i>. for such as have been found in the ash-pits
of Madisonville. On shell-work there is a section in Foster’s <i>Prehistoric Races</i> (p. 234); a paper by W. H.
Holmes in the <i>Second Rept. of the Bureau of Ethnology</i> (p. 179); and one on American shell-work and its
affinities by Miss Buckland in the <i>Journal Anthropol. Inst.</i>, xvi. 155.</p>

<p>From the primitive materials of stone, bone, horn, or shell, we pass to metals; but as Wilson (i. p. 174) says,
“if metal could be found capable of being wrought and fashioned without smelting or moulding, its use was
perfectly compatible with the simple arts of the stone period, as a mere malleable stone;” and to the present
day, he adds, the rude American race has no knowledge of working metal, except by pounding or grinding
it cold.<a name="FNanchor_1832_1832" id="FNanchor_1832_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_1832_1832" class="fnanchor">[1832]</a> The story which Brereton tells in his account of Gosnold’s visit (1602) to New England, about the
finding of abundant metal implements in use among the natives, is questioned (Baldwin’s <i>Ancient America</i>,
p. 62). We have the evidences of the early mining<a name="FNanchor_1833_1833" id="FNanchor_1833_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1833_1833" class="fnanchor">[1833]</a> of copper extending for over a hundred miles along the
southern shores of Lake Superior and on Isle Royale, in the abandoned trenches and tools first discovered
in 1847; and in one case there was found a mass of native copper (ten feet by three and two, and weighing
over six tons) which had been elevated on a wooden frame prior to removal, and was discovered in this condition.<a name="FNanchor_1834_1834" id="FNanchor_1834_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_1834_1834" class="fnanchor">[1834]</a>
There are also indications that the manufacture of copper tools was carried on in the neighborhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the mines (Wilson, i. 213); and chemical tests have shown that a popular belief in the tempering of metal
by these early peoples is without foundation.<a name="FNanchor_1835_1835" id="FNanchor_1835_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_1835_1835" class="fnanchor">[1835]</a></p>

<p>It seems to be a fact that while in the use of metals an intermediate stage of pure copper, as coming
between the use of bone and stone and the use of alloyed metals, was not until comparatively recently suspected
in Great Britain, the “peculiar interest attaches to the metallurgy of the new world that there all
the earlier stages are clearly defined: the pure native metal wrought by the hammer without the aid of fire;
the melted and moulded copper; the alloyed bronze; and the smelting, soldering, graving, and other processes
resulting from accumulating experience and matured skill” (Wilson, i. 230). It is in the regions extending
from Mexico to Peru that the art of alloying introduces us to the American bronze age. Columbus in his
fourth voyage found in a vessel which had come alongside from Yucatan crucibles to melt copper, as Herrera
tells us; and Humboldt was among the earliest to discover tools alloyed of copper and tin, and many such
alloys have since been recognized among Peruvian bronzes (Wilson, i. 239). In Mexico, metallurgic arts were
carried perhaps even farther in casting and engraving, and not only the results but the evidences of their
mining places have remained to our day (<i>Ibid.</i> i. 248). It seems evident, however, that experimenting with
them had not carried them so near the perfect combination for tool-making (one part tin to nine parts copper)
as the bronze people of Europe had reached, though they fell considerably short of the exact standard (<i>Ibid.</i>
i. 234). Doubt has sometimes been expressed of Mexican mining for copper, as by Frederick von Hellwald
(<i>Compte Rendu, Cong. des Américanistes</i>, 1877, i. 51); but Rau indicated the references<a name="FNanchor_1836_1836" id="FNanchor_1836_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_1836_1836" class="fnanchor">[1836]</a> to Short
(p. 94), which forcibly led him to the conclusion that the Mexicans mined copper to turn into tools.<a name="FNanchor_1837_1837" id="FNanchor_1837_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837_1837" class="fnanchor">[1837]</a> Among
the Mayas, Nadaillac (p. 269) contends that only copper and gold were in use. Bancroft (ii. 749) thinks the
use of copper doubtful, and if used, that it must have been got from the north. He cites the evidences of the
use of gold. William H. Holmes discusses <i>The use of gold and other metals among the ancient inhabitants
of Chiriqui, Isthmus of Darien</i> (Washington, 1887). As to iron, that found in the Ohio mounds, only of late
years, has been proved to be meteoric iron by Professor Putnam (<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Apr., 1883). Bancroft
(i. 164) says iron was in use among the British Columbian tribes before contact with the whites, but it was
probably derived through some indirect means from the whites. Though iron ore abounds in Peru, and the
character of the Peruvian stone-cutting would seem to indicate its use, and though there is a native word for
it, no iron implements have been found.<a name="FNanchor_1838_1838" id="FNanchor_1838_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838_1838" class="fnanchor">[1838]</a> There is not much recorded of the use of silver. It has been found
by Putnam in the mounds in thin sheets, used as plating for other metals.<a name="FNanchor_1839_1839" id="FNanchor_1839_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1839_1839" class="fnanchor">[1839]</a> He has also found native silver
in masses, and in one case a small bit of hammered gold.</p>

<p class="p2">Wilson, in 1876, while regretting the dispersion of the William Bullock collection of pottery, the destruction
of that formed by Stephens and Catherwood, and the transference to an English museum of most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
specimens gathered by Squier and Davis, lamented that no American collection<a name="FNanchor_1840_1840" id="FNanchor_1840_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840_1840" class="fnanchor">[1840]</a> had been yet formed adequate
to the requirements of the students of American archæology and ethnology. Since that date, however, the
collections in the National Museum (Smithsonian Institution) at Washington and in the Peabody Museum at
Cambridge have largely grown; and especially for the fictile art and work in stone of Spanish North America
the Museo Nacional in Mexico has assumed importance. The collection in the possession of the American
Philosophical Society in Philadelphia,<a name="FNanchor_1841_1841" id="FNanchor_1841_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841_1841" class="fnanchor">[1841]</a> since transferred to the Philadelphia Academy, is also of value for the
study of the pottery of middle America.</p>

<p>Rau has supplied a leading paper on American pottery in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1866; and E. A. Barber
has touched the subject in papers at the Copenhagen, Luxembourg, and Madrid meetings of the Congrès des
Américanistes, and in the <i>American Antiquarian</i> (viii. 76).<a name="FNanchor_1842_1842" id="FNanchor_1842_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842_1842" class="fnanchor">[1842]</a> W. H. Holmes has a paper on the origin and
development of form and of ornament in ceramic art in the <i>Fourth Report, Bureau of Ethnology</i>, p. 437.</p>

<p>For local characters there are various monographs.<a name="FNanchor_1843_1843" id="FNanchor_1843_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843_1843" class="fnanchor">[1843]</a></p>

<p>There is no satisfactory evidence that the potter’s wheel was known to
any American tribe; but Wilson, in his chapter on ceramic art (<i>Prehistoric
Man</i>, ii. ch. 16), feels convinced that the early potter employed
some sort of mechanical process, giving a revolving motion to his clay.</p>

<p>Modelling in clay for other purposes than the making of vessels is also
considered in this same seventeenth chapter of Wilson, and the subject
runs, as respects masks, figurines, and general ornamentation, into the wide
range of aboriginal art, which necessarily makes part of all comprehensive
histories of art. W. H. Dall has a paper on Indian masks in the <i>Third
Report, Bureau of Ethnology</i>, p. 73. The subject is further treated by
Wilson in a paper on “The artistic faculty in the aboriginal races,” in the
<i>Proceedings</i> (iii., 2d part, 67, 119) of the Royal Society of Canada, and
again in a general way by Nadaillac on <i>L’art préhistorique en Amérique</i> (Paris, 1883),
taken from the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>, Nov. 1, 1883.<a name="FNanchor_1844_1844" id="FNanchor_1844_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844_1844" class="fnanchor">[1844]</a></p>

<p class="p2">As regards the textile art in prehistoric times, see for a general view
W. H. Holmes in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, viii. 261; and the same
archæologist has treated the subject on the evidences of the impression
of textures as preserved in pottery, in the <i>Third Rept. Bur. of Ethnology</i>,
p. 393. Cf. Sellers in <i>Popular Science Journal</i>, and Wyman in <i>Peabody
Museum Reports</i>.</p>

<p>J. W. Foster first made (1838) the discovery of relics of textile fabrics of the moundbuilders; but he did
not announce his discovery till at the Albany meeting (1851) of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (<i>Transactions</i>, 1852, vol. vi. p. 375). He tells the story in his <i>Prehistoric Races</i>, p. 222, and
figures the implements, found in the mounds, supposed to be employed in the making their cloth with warp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and woof. Putnam has since made similar discoveries (<i>Peabody Museum Reports</i>). The subject is also
treated in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Davenport Academy and of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science. The fabrics were preserved by being placed in contact with copper implements.</p>

<p>The Indians of New Mexico were found by the Spaniards in possession of the art of weaving. Cf. Washington
Matthews on the Navajo weavers, in the <i>Third Rept. Bur. of Ethnology</i>, p. 371, and Bancroft (i. 582),
who also records the making of fabrics by the wild tribes of Central America (<i>Ibid.</i> i. 766-67). He also notes
the references to the textile manufactures of the Nahuas and Mayas (ii. 484, 752). The richest accumulation
of graphic data relative to the fabrics of Peru is contained in the great work on the <i>Necropolis of Ancon</i>.</p>

<p>Feather-work was an important industry in some parts of the continent. The subject is studied in Ferdinand
Denis’ <i>Arte plumaria: Les plumes, leur valeur et leur emploi dans les arts au Méxique, au Pérou,
au Brésil et dans les Indes et dans l’Océanie</i> (Paris, 1875).<a name="FNanchor_1845_1845" id="FNanchor_1845_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845_1845" class="fnanchor">[1845]</a></p>

<p>Lewis H. Morgan’s <i>Houses and House-life of the American Aborigines</i> (Washington, 1881) is the completest
study of the habitations of the early peoples; but it is written too exclusively in the light of universal
communal custom, and this must be borne in mind in using it. The edifices of middle America and Peru
have been given a bibliographical apparatus in another part of the present volume; but references may be
made to Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i> (ii. ch. 16), Viollet le Duc’s <i>Habitations of Man</i>, translated by R. Bucknall
(Boston, 1876), and to Bandelier’s <i>Archæological Tour</i>, 226, where he quotes as typical the description of
a native house in 1583, drawn by Juan Bautista Pomar.</p>

<p>There is no good comprehensive account of American prehistoric trade. The T-shaped pieces of copper in
use by the Mexicans came nearest to currency as we understand it, unless it be the wampum of the North
American Indians, and the shell money in use on the Pacific coast; but it should be remembered that copper
axes and copper plates served such a purpose with some tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1846_1846" id="FNanchor_1846_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">[1846]</a> The Peruvians used weights, but the Mexicans
did not. The latter had, however, a system of measures of length.<a name="FNanchor_1847_1847" id="FNanchor_1847_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847_1847" class="fnanchor">[1847]</a> The canoe was a great intermediary
in the practice of barter.<a name="FNanchor_1848_1848" id="FNanchor_1848_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_1848_1848" class="fnanchor">[1848]</a> The Peruvians alone understood the use of sails, and the earliest Spanish
navigators on the Pacific were surprised at what they thought were civilized predecessors in those seas when
they espied in the distance the large white sails of the Peruvian rafts of burden.<a name="FNanchor_1849_1849" id="FNanchor_1849_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_1849_1849" class="fnanchor">[1849]</a> The chief source of trade
in such conditions was barter, and we know how the Mexican travelling merchants got information that was
availed of by the Mexican marauders in their invasions. Bandelier<a name="FNanchor_1850_1850" id="FNanchor_1850_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1850_1850" class="fnanchor">[1850]</a> gives us the references on the barter
system, the traders, and the currency in that country, and we need to consult Dr. W. Behrnauer’s <i>Essai sur le
Commerce dans l’ancien Méxique et en Pérou</i>, in the <i>Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France</i> (n. s., vol. i.).</p>

<p>All the treatises on the mounds of the Ohio Valley derive illustrations of intertribal traffic from the shells
of the coast, the copper of Lake Superior, the mica of the Alleghanies, the obsidian of the Rocky Mountains
or of Mexico, and the unique figurines which the explorations of the mounds have disclosed. Charles
Rau has a paper on this aboriginal trade in North America, published in the <i>Archiv für Anthroplogie</i> (Braunschweig,
1872, vol. iv.), which was republished in English in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1872, p. 249. Bancroft’s
references under “Commerce” (v. p. 668) will help the student out in various particulars.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON AMERICAN LINGUISTICS.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>By the Editor.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> cannot be said that the study of American linguistics has advanced to a position wholly satisfactory. It
is beset with all the difficulties belonging to a subject that has not been embraced in written records for long
periods, and it is open to the hazards of articulation and hearing, acting without entire mutual confidence.
And yet we may not dispute Max Müller’s belief,<a name="FNanchor_1851_1851" id="FNanchor_1851_1851"></a><a href="#Footnote_1851_1851" class="fnanchor">[1851]</a> that it is the science of language which has given the first
comprehensive impulse to the study of mankind.</p>

<p>Out of the twenty distinct sounds which it is said the voice of man can produce,<a name="FNanchor_1852_1852" id="FNanchor_1852_1852"></a><a href="#Footnote_1852_1852" class="fnanchor">[1852]</a> there have been built up
from roots and combinations a great diversity of vocabularies. Comparisons of these, as well as of the
methods of forming sentences, have been much used in investigations of ethnical relations. Of these opposing
methods, neither is sufficiently strong, it is probable, to be pressed without the aid of the other, though the
belief of the Bureau of Ethnology at Washington, under the influence of Major Powell, practically discards all
tests but the vocabulary, in tracing ethnological relations. It is held that this one test of words satisfies, as to
customs, myths, and other ethnological traits, more demands of classifications than any other. Granted that it
does, there are questions yet unsolvable by it; and many ethnologists hold that there are still other tests, physiological,
for instance,<a name="FNanchor_1853_1853" id="FNanchor_1853_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853_1853" class="fnanchor">[1853]</a> which cannot safely be neglected in settling such complex questions. The favorite claim
of the Bureau is that its officers are studying man as a human being, and not as an animal; but it is by no
means sure that the physical qualities of man are so disconnected with his mind and soul as to be unnecessary
to his interpretation. Even if language be given the chief place in such studies, there is still the doubt if the
vocabulary can in all ways be safely followed to the exclusion of the structure of the language; and it is not
to be forgotten, as Haven recognized thirty years ago, that “one of the greatest obstacles to a successful and
satisfactory comparison of Indian vocabularies is caused by the capricious and ever-varying orthography applied
by writers of different nations.” This is a chance of error that cannot be eliminated when we have to deal with
lists of words made in the past, by persons not to be communicated with, in whom both national and personal
peculiarities of ear and vocal organs may exist to perplex. A part of the difficulty is of course removed by
trained assistants acting in concert, though in different fields; but the individual sharpness or dulness of ear
and purity and obscurity of articulation will still cause diversity of results,&mdash;to say nothing of corresponding
differences in the persons questioned. There is still the problem, broader than all these divisionary tests,
whether language is at all a safe test of race, and on this point there is room for different opinions, as is shown
in the discussions of Sayce, Whitney, and others.<a name="FNanchor_1854_1854" id="FNanchor_1854_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854_1854" class="fnanchor">[1854]</a> “Any attempt,” says Max Müller, “at squaring the classification
of races and tongues must necessarily fail.”<a name="FNanchor_1855_1855" id="FNanchor_1855_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855_1855" class="fnanchor">[1855]</a> On the other hand, George Bancroft (Final revision,
ii. 90) says that “the aspect of the red men was so uniform that there is no method of grouping them into
families but by their languages.”</p>

<p>It is the wide margin for error, already indicated, that vitiates much that has already been done in philological
comparisons, and the over-eager recognition at all times of what is thought to be the word-shunting of
“Grimm’s Law” has doubtless been responsible for other confusions.<a name="FNanchor_1856_1856" id="FNanchor_1856_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856_1856" class="fnanchor">[1856]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the general philological treatises touch more or less intimately the question of language as a test
of race,<a name="FNanchor_1857_1857" id="FNanchor_1857_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857_1857" class="fnanchor">[1857]</a> and all of them engage in tracing affinities, each with confidence in a method that others with equal
assurance may belittle.<a name="FNanchor_1858_1858" id="FNanchor_1858_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858_1858" class="fnanchor">[1858]</a> Thus Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_1859_1859" id="FNanchor_1859_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859_1859" class="fnanchor">[1859]</a> reflecting an opinion long prevalent, says that “positive grammatical
rules carry with them much more weight than mere word likenesses,”<a name="FNanchor_1860_1860" id="FNanchor_1860_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860_1860" class="fnanchor">[1860]</a> while, on the contrary, Dawson<a name="FNanchor_1861_1861" id="FNanchor_1861_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861_1861" class="fnanchor">[1861]</a>
says that “grammar is, after all, only the clothing of language. The science consists in its root-words; and
multitudes of root-words are identical in the American languages over vast areas.” This last proposition is,
as we have seen, the principle on which this inquiry is now conducted with governmental patronage. “Each
American language,” says George Bancroft, in his chapter on the dialects of North America, “was competent
of itself, without improvement of scholars, to exemplify every rule of the logician and give utterance to every
passion.” In accordance with such perhaps extreme views, it has been usually said that the American languages
are in development in advance of aboriginal progress in other respects. It is another common observation
that while a certain resemblance runs through all the native tongues,<a name="FNanchor_1862_1862" id="FNanchor_1862_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862_1862" class="fnanchor">[1862]</a> there is no such general resemblance
to the old-world languages;<a name="FNanchor_1863_1863" id="FNanchor_1863_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863_1863" class="fnanchor">[1863]</a> but at the same time the linguistic proof of the unity of the American race is
not irrefragable,<a name="FNanchor_1864_1864" id="FNanchor_1864_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864_1864" class="fnanchor">[1864]</a> and it would take tens of thousands of years, as Brinton holds, if there had been a single
source, for the eighty stocks of the North American and for the hundred South American speeches to have
developed themselves in all their varieties.<a name="FNanchor_1865_1865" id="FNanchor_1865_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865_1865" class="fnanchor">[1865]</a> Proceeding beyond stocks to dialects, and counting varieties,
Ludewig, in his <i>Literature of the American Languages</i>, gave 1,100 different American languages; but an
alphabetical list given by H. W. Bates in his <i>Central America, West Indies and South America</i> (London,
1882, 2d ed.)<a name="FNanchor_1866_1866" id="FNanchor_1866_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_1866_1866" class="fnanchor">[1866]</a> affords 1,700 names of such. The number, of course, depends on how exclusive we are in grouping
dialects. Squier, for instance, gives only 400 tongues for both North and South America; for, as
Nadaillac says, “philology has no precise definition of what constitutes a language.”<a name="FNanchor_1867_1867" id="FNanchor_1867_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867_1867" class="fnanchor">[1867]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>The most comprehensive survey of the bibliography of American linguistics, excluding South America, is
in Pilling’s <i>Proof-sheets of a bibliography of the languages of the North American Indians</i> (Washington,
1885), a tentative issue of the Bureau of Ethnology, already mentioned. Pilling also earlier catalogued the
linguistic MSS. in the library of the Bureau of Ethnology, in Powell’s <i>First Report</i> of that Bureau (p. 553),
in which that bibliographer also gave a sketch of the history of gathering such collections. A section of the
<i>Bibliotheca Americana</i> of Charles Leclerc (Paris, 1878) is given to linguistics, and it affords by groups one of
the best keys to the literature of the aboriginal languages which we yet have, and it has been supplemented
by additional lists issued since by Maisonneuve of Paris. Ludewig’s <i>Literature of American Aboriginal
Languages, with additions by W. Turner</i> (London, 1858), was up to date, thirty years ago, a good list of
grammars and dictionaries, but the increase has been considerable in this field since then (Pilling’s <i>Eskimo
Languages</i>, p. 62). The libraries of collectors of Spanish-American history, as enumerated elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1868_1868" id="FNanchor_1868_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868_1868" class="fnanchor">[1868]</a> have
usually included much on the linguistic history, and the most important of the printed lists for Mexico and
Central America is that of Brasseur de Bourbourg’s <i>Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne, précédée d’un
coup d’œil sur les études américaines dans leurs rapports avec les études classiques, et suivi du tableau, par
ordre alphabétique, des ouvrages de linguistique américaine contenus dans le même volume</i> (Paris, 1871).
This list is repeated with additions in the <i>Catalogue de Alphonse L. Pinart et ... de Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>
(Paris, 1883). Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i> characterizes some of the leading books up to 1873; but
the best source up to about the same date for a large part of North America is found in the notes in that
section of Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i>, vol. iii., given to linguistics.<a name="FNanchor_1869_1869" id="FNanchor_1869_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_1869_1869" class="fnanchor">[1869]</a> The several <i>Comptes Rendus</i> of the Congrès
des Américanistes have sections on the same subject, and the second volume of the <i>Contributions to North
American Ethnology</i>, published by the U. S. Geological Survey (Powell’s), has been kept back for the completion
of the linguistic studies of the government officials, which will ultimately, under the care of A. S.
Gatschet, compose that belated volume. Major Powell, in his conduct of ethnological investigations for the
United States government, has found efficient helpers in James C. Pilling, J. Owen Dorsey, S. R. Riggs,
A. S. Gatschet, not to name others. Powell outlined some of his own views in an address on the evolution of
language before the Anthropological Society of Washington, of which there is an abstract in their <i>Transactions</i>
(1881), while the paper can be found in perfected shape as “The evolution of language from a study
of the Indian languages,” in the <i>First Report of the Bureau of Ethnology</i>.</p>

<p>Among the earliest of the students of the native languages in the north were the Catholic missionaries in
Canada and in the northwest, and there is much of interest in their observations as recorded in the <i>Jesuit
Relations</i>. We find a <i>Dictionnaire de la langue huronne</i> in the <i>Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons</i> (Paris,
1632, etc.).</p>

<p>The most conspicuous of the English publications of the seventeenth century was the Natick rendering of
the <i>Bible</i> for the Massachusetts Indians, undertaken by the Apostle John Eliot, as he was called, at the
expense of the London Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Eliot also published a <i>Grammar of the
Massachusetts Indian Language</i> (Cambridge, 1666), which, with notes by Peter S. Duponceau and an introduction
by John Pickering, was printed for the Mass. Hist. Society in 1822, as was John Cotton’s <i>Vocabulary
of the Massachusetts Indian Language</i> (Cambridge, 1830). Roger Williams’ <i>Key into the language of
America</i> has been elsewhere referred to.<a name="FNanchor_1870_1870" id="FNanchor_1870_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1870_1870" class="fnanchor">[1870]</a> The Rev. Jonathan Edwards wrote a paper on the language of the
Mohegan Indians, which, with annotations by Pickering, was printed in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> in 1823,
and is called by Haven (<i>Archæol. U. S.</i>, 29) the earliest exposition of the radical connection of the American
languages. Dr. James Hammond Trumbull, the most learned of the students of these eastern languages,
has furnished various papers on them in the publications of the American Philological Association and of the
American Antiquarian Society,<a name="FNanchor_1871_1871" id="FNanchor_1871_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871_1871" class="fnanchor">[1871]</a> and has summarized the literature of the subject, with references, in the
<i>Memorial Hist. of Boston</i> (vol. i.).</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century there were several philological recorders among the missionaries. Sebastian
Rasle made a <i>Dictionary of the Abnake Language</i>, now preserved in MS. in Harvard College library, which,
edited by John Pickering, was published as a volume of the <i>Memoirs</i> of the Amer. Academy of Arts and
Sciences in 1833. A grammatical sketch of the Abnake as outlined in Rasle’s <i>Dictionary</i> is given by M. C.
O’Brien in the <i>Maine Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vol. ix. The publications of the American Philosophical Society in
Philadelphia have preserved for us the vocabularies and grammars of the Delaware language, collected and
arranged by John Heckewelder<a name="FNanchor_1872_1872" id="FNanchor_1872_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872_1872" class="fnanchor">[1872]</a> and David Zeisberger, while the latter Moravian missionary collected a
considerable MS. store of linguistic traces of the Indian tongues, a part of which is now preserved in Harvard
College library.<a name="FNanchor_1873_1873" id="FNanchor_1873_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">[1873]</a> One of this last collection, an <i>Indian Dictionary; English, German, Iroquois</i> (<i>the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
Onondaga</i>), <i>and Algonquin</i> (<i>the Delaware</i>) (Cambridge, 1887,) has been carefully edited for the press by
Eben Norton Horsford. Dr. John G. Shea published a <i>Dictionnaire Français-Onontagué, édité d’après un
manuscrit du 17<sup>e</sup> siècle</i> (N. Y., 1859), which is preserved in the Mazarin library in Paris.</p>

<p>There was no attempt made to treat the study of the American languages in what would now be termed a
scientific spirit by any English scholar till towards the end of the eighteenth century. The whole question of
the origin of the Indians had for a long time been the subject of discussion, and it had of necessity taken more
or less of a philological turn from the beginning; but the inquiry had been simply a theoretical one, with
efforts to substantiate preconceived beliefs rather than to formulate inductive ones, as in such works as&mdash;not
to name others&mdash;Adair’s <i>American Indians</i> (London, 1775), where every trace was referable to the Jews,
and Count de Gebelin’s <i>Monde Primitif</i> (Paris, 1781), where a comparison of American and European
vocabularies is given.<a name="FNanchor_1874_1874" id="FNanchor_1874_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874_1874" class="fnanchor">[1874]</a></p>

<p>A much closer student appeared in Benjamin Smith Barton, of Philadelphia, though he was not wholly
emancipated from these same prevalent notions of connecting the Indian tongues with the old-world speeches.
He says that he was instigated to the study by Pallas’ <i>Linguarum totius orbis Vocabularia comparativa</i>
(Petropolis, 1786, 1789), and the result was his <i>New View of the Origin of the tribes and nations of America</i>
(Philad., 1797; again, 1798). He sets forth in his introduction his methods of study. Charlevoix had suggested
that the linguistic test was the only one in studying the ethnological connections of these peoples;
but Barton asserted that there were other manifestations, equally important, like the physical aspects, the
modes of worship, and the myths. He examined forty different Indian languages, and thinks they show a
common origin, and that remotely a connection existed between the old and new continents.</p>

<p>The most eminent American student<a name="FNanchor_1875_1875" id="FNanchor_1875_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875_1875" class="fnanchor">[1875]</a> of this field in the early half of this century was Albert Gallatin.
He began his observations in 1823, at the instance of Humboldt, and two years later he took advantage of a
representative convocation of Indian tribes, then held in Washington, to continue his studies of their speech.
In 81 tribes brought under his notice he found what he thought to be 27 or 28 linguistic families. This was
a wider survey than had before been made, and he regretted that he was not privileged to profit by the vocabularies
collected by Lewis and Clark, which had unfortunately been lost. At the request of the Amer. Antiquarian
Society, he wrote out and enlarged this study in the second volume of their <i>Collections</i> in 1836, and
advanced views that he never materially changed, believing in a very remote Asiatic origin of the tongues, and
without excepting the Eskimos from his conclusions. In 1845, in his <i>Notes on the semi-civilized nations of
Mexico</i>, his conclusions were much the same, but he made an exception in favor of the Otomis. At this time
he counted more than a hundred languages, similar in structure but different in vocabularies, and he argued
that a very long period was necessary thus to differentiate the tongues. At the age of eighty-seven Gallatin
gave his final results in vol. ii. of the <i>Transactions of the American Ethnological Society</i> (1848). Gallatin
published a review<a name="FNanchor_1876_1876" id="FNanchor_1876_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876_1876" class="fnanchor">[1876]</a> of the volume on Ethnography and Philology, which had been prepared by Horatio Hale
as the seventh volume of the <i>Publications of the Wilkes United States Exploring Expedition</i> (1838-42), and
Hale himself, then in the beginning of his reputation as a linguistic scholar,<a name="FNanchor_1877_1877" id="FNanchor_1877_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877_1877" class="fnanchor">[1877]</a> published some papers of his
own in the same volume of the <i>Transactions</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1878_1878" id="FNanchor_1878_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878_1878" class="fnanchor">[1878]</a></p>

<p>The two Americans who have done more than others, without the aid of the government, to organize
aboriginal linguistic studies are Dr. John Gilmary Shea of Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Dr. Daniel Garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
Brinton of Philadelphia. Of <i>Shea’s Library of American Linguistics</i> he has given an account in the <i>Smithsonian
Rept.</i>, 1861.<a name="FNanchor_1879_1879" id="FNanchor_1879_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_1879_1879" class="fnanchor">[1879]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Brinton has set forth the purposes of his linguistic studies in an address before the Pennsylvania
Historical Society, <i>American Aboriginal Languages and why we should study them</i> (Philad., 1885,&mdash;from
the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>, 1885, p. 15). In starting his <i>Library of Aboriginal American Literature</i>,
he announced his purpose to put within the reach of scholars authentic materials for the study of
the languages and culture of the native races, each work to be the production of the native mind, and to be
printed in the original tongue, with a translation and notes, and to have some intrinsic historical or ethnological
importance.<a name="FNanchor_1880_1880" id="FNanchor_1880_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_1880_1880" class="fnanchor">[1880]</a></p>

<p>The other considerable collections are both French. Alphonse L. Pinart published a <i>Bibliothèque de linguistique
et d’ethnographie Américaines</i> (Paris and San Francisco, 1875-82).<a name="FNanchor_1881_1881" id="FNanchor_1881_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_1881_1881" class="fnanchor">[1881]</a></p>

<p>The publishing house of Maisonneuve et Compagnie of Paris, which has done more than any other
business firm to advance these studies, has conducted a <i>Collection linguistique Américaine</i>, of much
value to American philologists.<a name="FNanchor_1882_1882" id="FNanchor_1882_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882_1882" class="fnanchor">[1882]</a></p>

<p>Other French studies have attracted attention. Pierre Etienne Duponceau published a <i>Mémoire sur le
système grammatical des langues de quelques nations indiennes de l’Amérique du Nord</i> (Paris, 1838).<a name="FNanchor_1883_1883" id="FNanchor_1883_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883_1883" class="fnanchor">[1883]</a> He
conducted a correspondence with the Rev. John Heckewelder respecting the American tongues, which is published
in the <i>Transactions of the Amer. Philosophical Society</i> (Phil., 1819), and he translated Zeisberger’s
<i>Delaware Grammar</i>.</p>

<p>The studies of the Abbé Jean André Cuoq have been upon the Algonquin dialects,<a name="FNanchor_1884_1884" id="FNanchor_1884_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884_1884" class="fnanchor">[1884]</a> and published mainly
in the <i>Actes de la Société philologique</i> (Paris, 1869 and later). His monographic <i>Etudes philologiques sur
quelques langues sauvages de l’Amérique</i> was printed at Montreal, 1866. It was the result of twenty years’
missionary work among the Iroquois and Algonquins, and besides a grammar contains a critical examination
of the works of Duponceau and Schoolcraft. Lucien Adam has been very comprehensive in his researches,
his studies being collected under the titles of <i>Etudes sur six langues Américaines</i> (Paris, 1878) and <i>Examen
grammatical comparé de seize langues Américaines</i> (Paris, 1878).<a name="FNanchor_1885_1885" id="FNanchor_1885_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885_1885" class="fnanchor">[1885]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>The papers of the Count Hyacinthe de Charencey have been in the first instance for the most part printed
in the <i>Revue de Linguistique</i>, the <i>Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne</i>, and the <i>Mémoires de l’Académie de
Caen</i>, and have wholly pertained to the tongues south of New Mexico; but his principal studies are collected
in his <i>Mélanges de philologie et de paléographie Américaines</i> (Paris, 1883).<a name="FNanchor_1886_1886" id="FNanchor_1886_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886_1886" class="fnanchor">[1886]</a></p>

<p>The most distinguished German worker in this field, if we except the incidental labors of Alexander and
William von Humboldt,<a name="FNanchor_1887_1887" id="FNanchor_1887_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887_1887" class="fnanchor">[1887]</a> is J. C. E. Buschmann, whose various linguistic labors cover the wide field of
the west coast of North America from Alaska to the Isthmus, with some of the regions adjacent on the east.
He published his papers in Berlin between 1853 and 1864, and many of them in the <i>Mémoires de l’Académie
de Berlin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1888_1888" id="FNanchor_1888_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888_1888" class="fnanchor">[1888]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Carl Hermann Berendt has published his papers in Spanish, English, and German, and some of them
will be found in the <i>Smithsonian Reports</i>, in the Berlin <i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i>, and in the <i>Revista de
Mérida</i>. Under the auspices of the American Ethnological Society, a fac-simile reproduction of his graphic
<i>Analytical Alphabet for the Mexican and Central American languages</i> was published in 1869, the result of
twelve years’ study in those countries.<a name="FNanchor_1889_1889" id="FNanchor_1889_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889_1889" class="fnanchor">[1889]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The languages of what are called the civilized nations of the central regions of America deserve more
particular attention.</p>

<p>In the Mexican empire the Aztec was largely predominant, but not exclusively spoken, for about twenty
other tongues were more or less in vogue in different parts. Humboldt and others have found occasional
traces in words of an earlier language than the Aztec or Nahua, but different from the Maya, which in Brasseur’s
opinion was the language of the country in those pre-Nahua days. Bancroft, contrary to some recent
philologists, holds the speech of the Toltec, Chichimec, and Aztec times to be one and the same.<a name="FNanchor_1890_1890" id="FNanchor_1890_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890_1890" class="fnanchor">[1890]</a> It was
perhaps the most copious and most perfected of all the aboriginal tongues; and in proof of this are cited the
opinions of the early Spanish scholars, the successes of the missionaries in the use of it in imparting the
subtleties of their faith, and the literary use which was made of it by the native scholars, as soon as they
had adapted the Roman alphabet to its vocabulary and forms.<a name="FNanchor_1891_1891" id="FNanchor_1891_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891_1891" class="fnanchor">[1891]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>The Maya has much the same prominence farther south that the Nahua has in the northerly parts of the
territory of the Spanish conquest, and a dialect of it, the Tzendal, still spoken near Palenqué, is considered
to be the oldest form of it, though probably this dialect was a departure from the original stock. It is one of
the evidences that the early Mayas may have come by way of the West India islands that modern philologists
say the native tongues of those islands were allied to the Maya. Bancroft (iii. 759, with other references,
760) refers to the list of spoken tongues given in Palacio’s <i>Carta al Rey de España</i> (1576) as the best enumeration
of the early Spanish writers.<a name="FNanchor_1892_1892" id="FNanchor_1892_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892_1892" class="fnanchor">[1892]</a> For its literary value we must consult some of the authorities like
Orozco y Berra, mentioned in connection with the Aztec. Squier published a <i>Monograph of authors who
have written on the languages of Central America, and collected vocabularies and composed works in the
native dialects of that country</i> (Albany, 1861,&mdash;100 copies), in which he mentions 110 such authors, and
gives a list of their printed and MS. works. Those who have used these native tongues for written productions
are named in Ludewig’s <i>Literature of the Amer. Aborig. Languages</i> (London, 1858) and in Brinton’s
<i>Aboriginal American Authors</i> (Phila., 1883).<a name="FNanchor_1893_1893" id="FNanchor_1893_1893"></a><a href="#Footnote_1893_1893" class="fnanchor">[1893]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>The philology of the South American peoples has not been so well compassed as that of the northern
continent. The classified bibliographies show the range of it under such heads as Ande (or Campa), Araucanians
(Chilena), Arrawak, Aymara, Brazil (the principal work being F. P. von Martius’s <i>Beiträge zur
Ethnographie und Sprachenkunde Amerika’s, zumal Brasiliens</i>, Leipzig, 1867, with a second part called
<i>Glossaria linguarum brasiliensium, Erlangen</i>, 1863), Chama, Chibcha (or Muysca, Mosca), Cumanagota,
Galibi, Goajira, Guarani, Kiriri (Kariri), Lule, Moxa, Paez, Quichua, Tehuelhet, Tonocote, Tupi, etc.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON THE MYTHS AND RELIGIONS
OF AMERICA.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>By the Editor.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> earliest scholarly examination of the whole subject, which has been produced by an American author,
is Daniel G. Brinton’s <i>Myths of the New World, a treatise on the symbolism and mythology of the Red
Race of America</i> (N. Y., 1868; 2d ed., 1876). It is a comparative study, “more for the thoughtful general
reader than for the antiquary,” as the author says. “The task,” he adds, “bristles with difficulties. Carelessness,
prepossessions, and ignorance have disfigured the subject with false colors and foreign additions without
number” (p. 3). After describing the character of the written, graphic, or symbolic records, which the student
of history has to deal with in tracing North American history back before the Conquest, he adds, while he
deprives mythology of any historical value, that the myths, being kept fresh by repetition, were also nourished
constantly by the manifestations of nature, which gave them birth. So while taking issue with those who
find history buried in the myths, he warns us to remember that the American myths are not the reflections
of history or heroes. In the treatment of his subject he considers the whole aboriginal people of America
as a unit, with “its religion as the development of ideas common to all its members, and its myths as the
garb thrown around those ideas by imaginations more or less fertile; but seeking everywhere to embody the
same notions.”<a name="FNanchor_1894_1894" id="FNanchor_1894_1894"></a><a href="#Footnote_1894_1894" class="fnanchor">[1894]</a> This unity of the American races is far from the opinion of other ethnologists.</p>

<p>Brinton gives a long bibliographical note on those who had written on the subject before him, in which he
puts, as the first (1819) to take a philosophical survey, Dr. Samuel Farmer Jarvis in a <i>Discourse on the religion
of the Indian tribes of North America</i>, printed in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Collections, iii.</i> (1821). Jarvis confined
himself to the tribes north of Mexico, and considered their condition, as he found it, one of deterioration
from something formerly higher. There had been, of course, before this, amassers of material, like the Jesuits
in Canada, as preserved in their <i>Relations</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1895_1895" id="FNanchor_1895_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895_1895" class="fnanchor">[1895]</a> sundry early French writers on the Indians,<a name="FNanchor_1896_1896" id="FNanchor_1896_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896_1896" class="fnanchor">[1896]</a> the English agents
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England, and the Moravian missionaries in Pennsylvania
and the Ohio country, to say nothing of the historians, like Loskiel (<i>Geschichte der Mission</i>, 1789),
Vetromile (<i>Abnakis and their History</i>, New York, 1866), Cusick (<i>Six Nations</i>), not to mention local observers,
like Col. Benjamin Hawkins, <i>Sketch of the Creek Country (Georgia Hist. Soc. Collections</i>, 1848, but
written about 1800).</p>

<p>If the placing of Brinton’s book as the earliest scholarly contribution is to be contested, it would be for
E. G. Squier’s <i>Serpent Symbol in America</i> (N. Y., 1851);<a name="FNanchor_1897_1897" id="FNanchor_1897_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897_1897" class="fnanchor">[1897]</a> but the book is not broadly based, except so far
as such comprehensiveness can be deduced from his tendency to consider all myths as having some force of
nature for their motive, and that all are traceable to an instinct that makes the worship of fire or of the sun
the centre of a system.<a name="FNanchor_1898_1898" id="FNanchor_1898_1898"></a><a href="#Footnote_1898_1898" class="fnanchor">[1898]</a> With this as the source of life, Squier allies the widespread phallic worship. In
Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i> (iii. p. 501) there is a summary of what is known of this American worship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
generative power. Brinton doubts (<i>Myths</i>, etc., 149) if anything like phallic worship really existed, apart
from a wholly unreligious surrender to appetite.</p>

<p>Another view which Squier maintains is, that above all this and pervading all America’s religious views
there was a sort of rudimentary monotheism.<a name="FNanchor_1899_1899" id="FNanchor_1899_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_1899_1899" class="fnanchor">[1899]</a></p>

<p>When we add to this enumeration the somewhat callow and wholly unsatisfactory contributions of Schoolcraft
in the great work on the <i>Indian Tribes of the United States</i> (1851-59), which the U. S. government in
a headlong way sanctioned, we have included nearly all that had been done by American authors in this field
when Bancroft published the third volume of his <i>Native Races</i>. This work constitutes the best mass of material
for the student&mdash;who must not confound mythology and religion&mdash;to work with, the subject being
presented under the successive heads of the origin of myths and of the world, physical and animal myths,
gods, supernatural beings, worship and the future state; but of course, like all Bancroft’s volumes, it must be
supplemented by special works pertaining to the more central and easterly parts of the United States, and to
the regions south of Panama. The deficiency, however, is not so much as may be expected when we consider
the universality of myths. “Unfortunately,” says this author, “the philologic and mythologic material for
such an exhaustive synthesis of the origin and relations of the American creeds as Cox has given to the world
in the Aryan legends in his <i>Mythology of the Aryan Nations</i> (London, 1870) is yet far from complete.”</p>

<p>In 1882 Brinton, after riper study, again recast his views of a leading feature of the subject in his <i>American
hero-myths; a study in the native religions of the western continent</i> (Philad., 1882), in which he endeavored
to present “in a critically correct light some of the fundamental conceptions in the native beliefs.” His purpose
was to counteract what he held to be an erroneous view in the common practice of considering “American
hero-gods as if they had been chiefs of tribes at some undetermined epoch,” and to show that myths of
similar import, found among different peoples, were a “spontaneous production of the mind, and not a reminiscence
of an historic event.” He further adds as one of the impediments in the study that he does “not know
of a single instance on this continent of a thorough and intelligent study of a native religion made by a Protestant
missionary.”<a name="FNanchor_1900_1900" id="FNanchor_1900_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_1900_1900" class="fnanchor">[1900]</a> After an introductory chapter on the American myths, Brinton in this volume takes up
successively the consideration of the hero-gods of the Algonquins and Iroquois, the Aztecs, Mayas, and the
Quichuas of Peru. These myths of national heroes, civilizers, and teachers are, as Brinton says, the fundamental
beliefs of a very large number of American tribes, and on their recognition and interpretation depends
the correct understanding of most of their mythology and religious life,&mdash;and this means, in Brinton’s view,
that the stories connected with these heroes have no historic basis.<a name="FNanchor_1901_1901" id="FNanchor_1901_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_1901_1901" class="fnanchor">[1901]</a></p>

<p>The best known of the comprehensive studies by a European writer is J. G. Müller’s <i>Geschichte der Amerikanischen
Urreligionen</i> (Basle, 1855; again in 1867), in which he endeavors to work out the theory that at the
south there is a worship of nature, with a sun-worship for a centre, contrasted at the north with fetichism and
a dread of spirits, and these he considers the two fundamental divisions of the Indian worship. Bancroft finds
him a chief dependence at times, but Brinton, charging him with quoting in some instances at second-hand,
finds him of no authority whatever.</p>

<p>One of the most reputable of the German books on kindred subjects is the <i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i>
(Leipzig, 1862-66) of Theodor Waitz. Brinton’s view of it is that no more comprehensive, sound, and critical
work on the American aborigines has been written; but he considers him astray on the religious phases, and
that his views are neither new nor tenable when he endeavors to subject moral science to a realistic philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_1902_1902" id="FNanchor_1902_1902"></a><a href="#Footnote_1902_1902" class="fnanchor">[1902]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>In speaking of the scope of the comprehensive work of H. H. Bancroft we mentioned that beyond the larger
part of the great Athapascan stock of the northern Indians his treatment did not extend. Such other general
works as Brinton’s <i>Myths of the New World</i>, the sections of his <i>American Hero-Myths</i> on the hero-gods of
the Algonquins and Iroquois, and the not wholly satisfactory book of Ellen R. Emerson, <i>Indian myths; or,
Legends, traditions, and symbols of the aborigines of America, compared with those of other countries, including
Hindostan, Egypt, Persia, Assyria, and China</i> (Boston, 1884), with aid from such papers as Major
J. W. Powell’s “Philosophy of the North American Indians” in the <i>Journal of the Amer. Geographical
Society</i> (vol. viii. p. 251, 1876), and his “Mythology of the North American Indians” in the <i>First Annual
Rept. of the Bureau of Ethnology</i> (1881), and R. M. Dorman’s <i>Origin of primitive superstition among the
aborigines of America</i> (Philad., 1881), must suffice in a general way to cover those great ethnic stocks of the
more easterly part of North America, which comprise the Iroquois, centred in New York, and surrounded
by the Algonquins, west of whom were the Dacotas, and south of whom were the Creeks, Choctaws, and
Chickasaws, sometimes classed together as Appalachians.<a name="FNanchor_1903_1903" id="FNanchor_1903_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903_1903" class="fnanchor">[1903]</a></p>

<p>The mythology of the Aztecs is the richest mine, and Bancroft in his third volume finds the larger part of
his space given to the Mexican religion.</p>

<p>Brinton (<i>Amer. Hero Myths</i>, 73, 78), referring to the “Historia de los Méxicanos por sus Pinturas” of
Ramirez de Fuenleal, as printed in the <i>Anales del Museo Nacional</i> (ii. p. 86), says that in some respects it is
to be considered the most valuable authority which we possess,<a name="FNanchor_1904_1904" id="FNanchor_1904_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904_1904" class="fnanchor">[1904]</a> as taken directly from the sacred books of the
Aztecs, and as explained by the most competent survivors of the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_1905_1905" id="FNanchor_1905_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905_1905" class="fnanchor">[1905]</a></p>

<p>We must also look to Ixtlilxochitl and Sahagún as leading sources. From Sahagún we get the prayers which
were addressed to the chief deity, of various names, but known best, perhaps, as Tezcatlipoca; and these invocations
are translated for us in Bancroft (iii. 199, etc.), who supposes that, consciously or unconsciously,
Sahagún has slipped into them a certain amount of “sophistication and adaptation to Christian ideas.” From
the lofty side of Tezcatlipoca’s character, Bancroft (iii. ch. 7) passes to his meaner characteristics as the
oppressor of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>The most salient features of the mythology of the Aztecs arise from the long contest of Tezcatlipoca and
Quetzalcoatl, the story of which modified the religion of their followers, and, as Chavero claims, greatly affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
their history.<a name="FNanchor_1906_1906" id="FNanchor_1906_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906_1906" class="fnanchor">[1906]</a> This struggle, according as the interpreters incline, stands for some historic or physical rivalry,
or for one between St. Thomas and the heathen;<a name="FNanchor_1907_1907" id="FNanchor_1907_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907_1907" class="fnanchor">[1907]</a> but Brinton explains it on his general principles as one
between the powers of Light and Darkness (<i>Am. Hero Myths</i>, 65).</p>

<p>The main original sources on the character and career of Quetzalcoatl are Motolinía, Mendieta, Sahagún,
Ixtlilxochitl, and Torquemada, and these are all summarized in Bancroft (iii. ch. 7).</p>

<p>It has been a question with later writers whether there is a foundation of history in the legend or myth of
Quetzalcoatl. Brinton (<i>Myths of the New World</i>, 180) has perhaps only a few to agree with him when he
calls that hero-god a “pure creature of the fancy, and all his alleged history nothing but a myth,” and he
thinks some confusion has arisen from the priests of Quetzalcoatl being called by his name.</p>

<p>Bandelier (<i>Archæol. Tour</i>) takes issue with Brinton in deeming Quetzalcoatl on the whole an historical
person, whom Ixtlilxochitl connects with the pre-Toltec tribes of Olmeca and Xicalanca, and whom Torquemada
says came in while the Toltecs occupied the country. Bandelier thinks it safe to say that Quetzalcoatl
began his career in the present state of Hidalgo as a leader of a migration moving southward, with a principal
sojourn at Cholula, introducing arts and a purer worship. This is substantially the view taken by J. G. Müller,
Prescott, and Wuttke.</p>

<p class="p2">What Tylor (<i>Primitive Culture</i>, ii. 279) calls “the inexplicable compound, parthenogenetic deity, the hideous,
gory Huitzilopochtli” (Huitziloputzli, Vitziliputzli), the god of war,<a name="FNanchor_1910_1910" id="FNanchor_1910_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910_1910" class="fnanchor">[1910]</a> the protector of the Mexicans, was
considered by Boturini (<i>Idea</i>, p. 60) as a deified ancient war-chief. Bancroft in his narrative (iii. 289, 294;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
iv. 559) quotes the accounts in Sahagún and Torquemada, and (pp. 300-322) summarizes J. G. Müller’s monograph
on this god, which he published in 1847, and which he enlarged when including it in his <i>Urreligionen</i>.</p>

<p>Acosta’s description of the Temple of Huitzilopochtli is translated in Bancroft (iii. 292). Solis follows
Acosta, while Herrera copies Gomara, who was not, as Solis contends, so well informed.</p>

<p>As regards the Votan myth of Chiapas, Brinton tells us something in his <i>American Hero Myths</i> (212, with

No complete translation has been made, and the abstracts are unsatisfactory. Bancroft aids us in
this study of worship in Chiapas (iii. 458), as also in that of Oajaca (iii. 448), Michoacan<a name="FNanchor_1912_1912" id="FNanchor_1912_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912_1912" class="fnanchor">[1912]</a> (iii. 445), and

<p>“The religion of the Mayas,” says Bancroft (iii. ch. 11), “was fundamentally the same as that of the Nahuas,
though it differed somewhat in outward forms. Most of the gods were deified heroes.... Occasionally we
find very distinct traces of an older sun-worship which has succumbed to later forms, introduced according to
vague tradition from Anahuac.” The view of Tylor (<i>Anahuac</i>, 191) is that the “civilization,” and consequently
the religions, of Mexico and Central America were originally independent, but that they came much
into contact, and thus modified one another to no small extent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>Modern scholars are not by any means so much inclined as Las Casas and the other Catholic fathers were to
recognize the dogma of the Trinity and other Christian notions, which have been thought to be traceable in
what the Maya people in their aboriginal condition held for faith.</p>

<p>The most popular of their deified heroes were Zamná and Cukulcan, not unlikely the same personage under
two names, and quite likely both are correspondences of Quetzalcoatl. We can find various views and alternatives
on this point among the elder and recent writers. The belief in community of attributes derives its
strongest aid from the alleged disappearance of Quetzalcoatl in Goazacoalco just at the epoch when Cukulcan
appeared in Yucatan. The centres of Maya worship were at Izamal, Chichen-Itza, and the island of
Cozumel.</p>

<p>The hero-gods of the Mayas is the topic of Brinton’s fourth chapter in his <i>American Hero Myths</i>, with
views of their historical relations of course at variance with those of Bancroft. As respects the material, he
says that “most unfortunately very meagre sources of information are open to us. Only fragments of their
legends and hints of their history have been saved, almost by accident, from the general wreck of their civilization.”
The heroes are Itzamná, the leader of the first immigration from the east, through the ocean pathways;
and Kukulcan, the conductor of the second from the west. For the first cycle of myths Brinton refers
to Landa’s <i>Relation</i>, Cogolludo’s <i>Yucatan</i>, Las Casas’s <i>Historia Apologética</i>, involving the reports of the
missionary Francisco Hernandez, and to Hieronimo Roman’s <i>De la Republica de las Indias Occidentales</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Kukulcan legends are considered by Brinton to be later in date and less natural in character, and
Hernandez’s Report to Las Casas is the first record of them. Brinton’s theory of the myths does not allow
him to identify the Quetzalcoatl and Kukulcan hero-gods as one and the same, nor to show that the Aztec
and Maya civilizations had more correspondence than occasional intercourse would produce; but he thinks
the similarity of the statue of “Chac Mool,” unearthed by Le Plongeon at Chichen-Itza, to another found at
Tlaxcala compels us to believe that some positive connection did exist in parts of the country (<i>Anales del
Museo Nacional</i>, i. 270).<a name="FNanchor_1913_1913" id="FNanchor_1913_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913_1913" class="fnanchor">[1913]</a> “The Nahua impress,” says Bancroft (iii. 490), “noticeable in the languages and
customs of Nicaragua, is still more strongly marked in the mythology. Instead of obliterating the older forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
of worship, as it seems to have done in the northern parts of Central America, it has here and there passed by
many of the distinct beliefs held by different tribes, and blended with the chief elements of a system which
is traced to the Muyscas in South America.”</p>

<p>The main source of the Quiché myths and worship is the <i>Popul Vuh</i>, but Bancroft (iii. 474), who follows
it, finds it difficult to make anything comprehensible out of its confusion of statement. But prominent
among the deities seem to stand Tepeu or Gucumatz, whom it is the fashion to make the same with Quetzalcoatl,
and Hurakan or Tohil, who indeed stands on a plane above Quetzalcoatl. Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, 156), on the
contrary, connects Hurakan with Tlaloc, and seems to identify Tohil with Quetzalcoatl. Bancroft (iii. 477)
says that tradition, name, and attributes connect Tohil and Hurakan, and identify them with Tlaloc.</p>

(<i>Arch. Tour</i>, pl. v) gives a photograph of it as it stands in the court-yard of the Museo Nacional.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Gallatin (<i>Am. Ethn. Soc. Trans.</i>, i. 338) describes Teoyaomiqui as the proper companion of Huitzilopochtli: “The
symbols of her attributes are found in the upper part of the statue; but those from the waist downwards relate to other
deities connected with her or with Huitzilopochtli.” Tylor (<i>Anahuac</i>, 222) says: “The antiquaries think that the figures
in it stand for different personages, and that it is three gods: Huitzilopochtli the god of war, Teoyaomiqui his wife, and
Mictlantecutli the god of hell.” Léon y Gama calls the statue Teoyaomiqui, but Bandelier, <i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 67, thinks
its proper name is rather Huitzilopochtli. Léon y Gama’s description is summarized in Bancroft, iii. 399, who cites also
what Humboldt (<i>Vues</i>, etc., ii. 153, and his pl. xxix) says. Bancroft (iii. 397) speaks of it as “a huge compound statue,
representing various deities, the most prominent being a certain Teoyaomiqui, who is almost identical with, or at least a
connecting link between, the mother goddess” and Mictlantecutli, the god of Mictlan, or Hades. Cf. references in Bancroft,
iv. 515.</p>

<p>Brinton’s <i>Names of the gods in the Kiché myths, a monograph on Central American mythology</i> (Philad.
Am. Philos. Soc., 1881), is a special study of a part of the subject.</p>

<p>Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, etc., 184) considers the best authorities on the mythology of the Muyscas of the Bogota
region to be Piedrahita’s <i>Historia de las Conquistas del Nuevo Reyno de Granada</i> (1668, followed by Humboldt
in his <i>Vues</i>) and Simm’s <i>Noticias historiales de las Conquistas de Tierra Firme en el Nuevo Reyno de
Granada</i>, given in Kingsborough, vol. viii.</p>

<p>The mythology of the Quichuas in Peru makes the staple of chap. 5 of Brinton’s <i>Amer. Hero-Myths</i>.
Here the corresponding hero-god was Viracocha. Brinton depends mainly on the <i>Relacion Anónyma de
los Costumbres Antiguos de los Naturales del Piru, 1615</i> (Madrid, 1879); on Christoval de Molina’s account
of the fables and religious customs of the Incas, as translated by C. R. Markham in the Hakluyt Society
volume, <i>Narratives of the Rites and Laws of the Yncas</i> (London, 1873); on the <i>Comentarios reales</i> of
Garcilasso de la Vega; on the report made to the viceroy Francisco de Toledo, in 1571, of the responses to
inquiries made in different parts of the country as to the old beliefs which appear in the “Informacion de las
idolatras de los Incas é Indios,” printed in the <i>Coleccion de documentos ineditos del archivo de Indias</i>, xxi.

Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, whose <i>Transactions</i> began in 1769, and made six volumes to 1809.
A second series was begun in 1818.<a name="FNanchor_1914_1914" id="FNanchor_1914_1914"></a><a href="#Footnote_1914_1914" class="fnanchor">[1914]</a> What are called the <i>Transactions of the Historical and Literary
Committee</i> make two volumes (1819, 1838), the first of which contains contributions by Heckewelder and P. S.
Duponceau on the history and linguistics of the Lenni Lenape. Its <i>Proceedings</i> began in 1838. The American
Academy of Arts and Sciences was instituted at Boston in 1780, a part of its object being “to promote
and encourage the knowledge of the antiquities of America,”<a name="FNanchor_1915_1915" id="FNanchor_1915_1915"></a><a href="#Footnote_1915_1915" class="fnanchor">[1915]</a> and its series of <i>Memoirs</i> began in 1783,<a name="FNanchor_1916_1916" id="FNanchor_1916_1916"></a><a href="#Footnote_1916_1916" class="fnanchor">[1916]</a> and
its <i>Proceedings</i> in 1846. These societies have only, as a rule, incidentally, and not often till of late years,
illustrated in their publications the antiquities of the new world; but the American Antiquarian Society was
founded in 1812 at Worcester, Mass., by Isaiah Thomas, with the express purpose of elucidating this department
of American history. It began the <i>Archæologia Americana</i> in 1820, and some of the volumes are still
valuable, though they chiefly stand for the early development by Atwater, Gallatin, and others of study in
this direction. In the first volume is an account of the origin and design of the society, and this is also set
forth in the memoir of Thomas prefixed to its reprint of his <i>History of Printing in America</i>, which is a part
of the series. The <i>Proceedings</i> of the society were begun in 1849, and they have contained some valuable
papers on Central American subjects. The Boston Society of Natural History<a name="FNanchor_1917_1917" id="FNanchor_1917_1917"></a><a href="#Footnote_1917_1917" class="fnanchor">[1917]</a> published the <i>Boston Journal
of Natural History</i> from 1834 to 1863, and in 1866 began its <i>Memoirs</i>. Col. Whittlesey gave in its first
volume a paper on the weapons and military character of the race of the mounds, and subsequent volumes
have had other papers of an archæological nature; but they have formed a small part of its contributions.
Its <i>Proceedings</i> have of late years contained some of the best studies of palæolithic man. The American
Ethnological Society, founded by Gallatin (New York), began its exclusive work in a series of <i>Transactions</i>
(1845-53, vols. i., ii., and one number of vol. iii.), but it was not of long continuance, though it embraced
among its contributors the conspicuous names of Gallatin, Schoolcraft, Catherwood, Squier, Rafn, S. G.
Morton, J. R. Bartlett, and others. Its <i>Bulletin</i> was not continued beyond a single volume (1860-61).<a name="FNanchor_1918_1918" id="FNanchor_1918_1918"></a><a href="#Footnote_1918_1918" class="fnanchor">[1918]</a> The
society was suspended in 1871.</p>

<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science began its publications with the <i>Proceedings</i> of
its Philadelphia meeting in 1848. Questions of archæology formed, however, but a small portion of its
inquiries<a name="FNanchor_1919_1919" id="FNanchor_1919_1919"></a><a href="#Footnote_1919_1919" class="fnanchor">[1919]</a> till the formation of a section on Anthropology a few years ago.</p>

<p>The American Geographical Society has published a <i>Bulletin</i> (1852-56); <i>Journal</i> (or <i>Transactions</i>) (1859),
etc., and <i>Proceedings</i> (1862-64). Some of the papers have been of archæological interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The Anthropological Institute of New York printed its transactions in a <i>Journal</i> (one vol. only, 1872-73).</p>

<p>The Archæological Institute of America was founded in Boston in 1879, and has given the larger part of
its interest to classical archæology. The first report of its executive committee said respecting the field in
the new world: “The study of American archæology relates, indeed, to the monuments of a race that never
attained to a high degree of civilization, and that has left no trustworthy records of continuous history....
From what it was and what it did, nothing is to be learned that has any direct bearing on the progress of
civilization. Such interest as attaches to it is that which it possesses in common with other early and undeveloped
races of mankind.” Appended to this report was Lewis H. Morgan’s “Houses of the American
Aborigines, with suggestions for the exploration of the ruins in New Mexico,” etc.,&mdash;advancing his well-known
views of the communal origin of the southern ruins. Under the auspices of the Institute, Mr. A. F.
Bandelier, a disciple of Morgan, was sent to New Mexico for the study of the Pueblos, and his experiences are
described in the second <i>Report</i> of the Institute. In their third <i>Report</i> (1882) the committee of the Institute
say: “The vast work of American archæology and anthropology is only begun.... Other nations, with more
or less of success, are trying to do our work on our soil. It is time that Americans bestir themselves in earnest
upon a field which it would be a shame to abandon to the foreigner.” Still under the pay of the Institute, Mr.
Bandelier, in 1881, devoted his studies to the remains at Mexico, Cholula, Mitla, and the ancient life of
those regions. At the same time, Aymé, then American consul at Merida, was commissioned to explore
certain regions of Yucatan, but the results were not fortunate.</p>

<p>The Institute began in 1881 the publication of an <i>American Series</i> of its <i>Papers</i>, the first number of which
embodied Bandelier’s studies of the Pueblos, and the second covered his Mexican researches. In 1885 the
<i>American Journal of Archæology</i> was started at Baltimore as the official organ of the Institute, and occasional
papers on American subjects have been given in its pages. The editors were called upon to define more particularly
their relations to archæology in America in the number for Sept., 1888. In this they say: “The
archæology of America is busied with the life and work of a race or races of men in an inchoate, rudimentary,
and unformed condition, who never raised themselves, even at their highest point, as in Mexico and Peru,
above a low stage of civilization, and never showed the capacity of steadily progressive development....
These facts limit and lower the interest which attaches ... to crude and imperfect human life.... A comparison
of their modes of life and thought with those of other races in a similar stage of development in other
parts of the world, in ancient and modern times, is full of interest as exhibiting the close similarity of primitive
man in all regions, resulting from the sameness of his first needs, in his early struggle for existence.” The
editors rest their reasons for giving prominence to classical archæology upon the necessity of affording by such
complemental studies the means of comparison in archæological results, which can but advance to a higher
plane the methods and inductions of the prehistoric archæology of America.</p>

<p>The American Folk-Lore Society was founded in Jan., 1888, and <i>The Journal of American Folk-Lore</i>
was immediately begun. A large share of its papers is likely to cover the popular tales of the American
aborigines.</p>

<p>The Anthropological Society of Washington is favorably situated to avail itself of the museums and
apparatus of the American government, and members of the Geological Survey and Ethnological Bureau have
been among the chief contributors to its <i>Transactions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1920_1920" id="FNanchor_1920_1920"></a><a href="#Footnote_1920_1920" class="fnanchor">[1920]</a> which in January, 1888, were merged in a more general
publication, <i>The American Anthropologist</i>. A National Geographic Society was organized in Washington in
1888.</p>

<p>There are numerous local societies throughout the United States whose purpose, more or less, is to cover
questions of archæological import. Those that existed prior to 1876 are enumerated in Scudder’s <i>Catalogue
of Scientific Serials</i>; but it was not easy always to draw the line between historical associations and those
verging upon archæological methods.<a name="FNanchor_1921_1921" id="FNanchor_1921_1921"></a><a href="#Footnote_1921_1921" class="fnanchor">[1921]</a></p>

<p>The oldest of the scientific periodicals in the United States to devote space to questions of anthropology is
Silliman’s <i>American Journal of Science and Arts</i> (1818, etc.). The <i>American Naturalist</i>, founded in 1867,
also entered the field of archæology and anthropology. The same may be said in some degree of the <i>Popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Science Monthly</i> (1877, etc.), <i>Science</i> (1883), and the <i>Kansas City Review</i>. The chief repository of such
contributions, however, since 1878, has been <i>The American Antiquarian</i> (Chicago), edited by Stephen D.
Peet. Its papers are, unluckily, of very uneven value.<a name="FNanchor_1922_1922" id="FNanchor_1922_1922"></a><a href="#Footnote_1922_1922" class="fnanchor">[1922]</a></p>

<p>The best organized work has been done in the United States by the Peabody Museum of American Archæology
and Ethnology, in Cambridge, Mass., and by certain departments of the Federal government at Washington.</p>

<p>The Peabody Museum resulted from a gift of George Peabody, an American banker living in London, who
instituted it in 1866 as a part of Harvard University.<a name="FNanchor_1923_1923" id="FNanchor_1923_1923"></a><a href="#Footnote_1923_1923" class="fnanchor">[1923]</a> It was fortunate in its first curator, Dr. Jeffries Wyman,
who brought unusual powers of comprehensive scrutiny to its work.<a name="FNanchor_1924_1924" id="FNanchor_1924_1924"></a><a href="#Footnote_1924_1924" class="fnanchor">[1924]</a> He died in 1874, and was succeeded by
one of his and of Agassiz’s pupils, Frederick W. Putnam, who was also placed in the chair of archæology in
the university in 1886. The <i>Reports</i>, now twenty-two in number, and the new series of <i>Special Papers</i> are
among the best records of progress in archæological science.</p>

<p>The creation of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846, under the bequest of an Englishman, James Smithson,
and the devotion of a sum of about $31,000 a year at that time arising from that gift, first put the government
of the United States in a position “to increase and diffuse knowledge among men.”<a name="FNanchor_1925_1925" id="FNanchor_1925_1925"></a><a href="#Footnote_1925_1925" class="fnanchor">[1925]</a></p>

<p>The second <i>Report</i> of the Regents in 1848 contains approvals of a manuscript by E. G. Squier and E. H.
Davis, which had been offered to the Institution for publication, and which had been commended by Albert
Gallatin, Edward Robinson, John Russell Bartlett, W. W. Turner, S. G. Morton, and George P. Marsh.
Thus an important archæological treatise, <i>The Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, comprising
the results of extensive original surveys and explorations</i> (Washington, 1848), became the first of the <i>Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge</i>. The subsequent volumes of the series have contained other important
treatises in similar fields. Foremost among them may be named those of Squier on the Aboriginal Monuments
of New York (vol. ii., 1851); Col. Whittlesey on <i>The Ancient Works in Ohio</i> (vol. iii., 1852); S. R.
Riggs’ <i>Dakota Grammar and Dictionary</i> (vol. iv., 1852); I. A. Lapham’s <i>Antiquities of Wisconsin</i> (vol. vii.,
1855); S. F. Haven’s <i>Archæology of the United States</i> (vol. viii., 1856); Brantz Mayer’s <i>Mexican History
and Archæology</i> (vol. ix., 1857); Whittlesey on <i>Ancient Mining on Lake Superior</i> (vol. xiii., 1863); Morgan’s
<i>Systems of Consanguinity of the human family</i> (vol. xvii., 1871);&mdash;not to name lesser papers. To
supplement this quarto series, another in octavo was begun in 1862, called <i>Miscellaneous Collections</i>; and in
this form there have appeared J. M. Stanley’s <i>Catalogue of portraits of No. Amer. Indians</i> (vol. ii., 1862); a
<i>Catalogue of photographic portraits of the No. Amer. Indians</i> (vol. xiv., 1878).</p>

<p>Of much more interest to the anthropologist has been the series of <i>Annual Reports</i> with their appended
papers,&mdash;such as Squier on <i>The Antiquities of Nicaragua</i> (1851); W. W. Turner on <i>Indian Philology</i>
(1852); S. S. Lyon on <i>Antiquities from Kentucky</i> (1858), and many others.</p>

<p>The sections of correspondence and minor papers in these reports soon began to include communications
about the development of archæological research in various localities. They began to be more orderly arranged
under the sub-heading of Ethnology in the Report for 1867, and this heading was changed to Anthropology in
the <i>Report</i> for 1879. Charles Rau (d. 1887) had been a leading contributor in this department, and no. 440 of
the Smithsonian publications was made up of his <i>Articles on Anthropological Subjects, contributed from
1863 to 1877</i> (Washington, 1882). No. 421 is Geo. H. Boehmer’s <i>Index to Anthropological Articles in the
publications of the Smithsonian Institution</i> (Washington, 1881). Among the later papers those of O. T.
Mason of the Anthropological Department of the National Museum are conspicuous.</p>

<p>The last series is the <i>Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology</i>, placed by Congress in the charge of the Smithsonian.
The <i>Reports of the American Historical Association</i> will soon be begun under the same auspices.</p>

<p>Major J. W. Powell, the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, said that its purpose was “to organize
anthropologic research in America.”<a name="FNanchor_1926_1926" id="FNanchor_1926_1926"></a><a href="#Footnote_1926_1926" class="fnanchor">[1926]</a> It published its first report in 1881, and this and the later reports have
had for contents, beside the summary of work constituting the formal report, the following papers:&mdash;</p>

and here are deposited the objects of archæological and historical interest secured by the government explorations
and by other means. The linguistic material is kept in the Bureau of Ethnology. The skulls and physiological
material, illustrative of prehistoric times, are deposited in the Army Medical Museum, under the
Surgeon-General’s charge.</p>

<p>Major Powell, while in charge of the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region,
had earlier prepared five volumes of <i>Contributions to Ethnology</i>, all but the second of which have been
published. The first volume (1877) contained W. H. Dall’s “Tribes of the Extreme Northwest” and
George Gibbs’ “Tribes of Western Washington and Northwestern Oregon.” The third (1877): Stephen
Powers’ “Tribes of California.” The fourth (1881): Lewis H. Morgan’s “Houses and house life of the
American Aborigines.” The fifth (1882): Charles Rau’s “Lapidarian sculpture of the Old World and in
America,” Robert Fletcher’s “Prehistoric trephining and cranial Amulets,” and Cyrus Thomas on the
Troano Manuscript, with an introduction by D. G. Brinton.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Reports</i> of the geographical and geological explorations and surveys west of the 100th meridian
conducted by Capt. Geo. M. Wheeler, the seventh volume, <i>Report on Archæological and Ethnological Collections
from the vicinity of Santa Barbara, California, and from ruined pueblos of Arizona and New
Mexico and certain Interior Tribes</i> (Washington, 1879), was edited by F. W. Putnam, and contains papers
on the ethnology of Southern California, wood and stone implements, sculptures, musical instruments, beads,
etc.; the Pueblos of New Mexico, their inhabitants, architecture, customs, cliff houses and other ruins, skeletons,
etc.; with an <i>Appendix</i> on Linguistics, containing forty Vocabularies of Pueblo and other Western
Indian Languages and their classification into seven families.</p>

<p>The <i>Reports</i> of the Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, under the charge of F. V.
Hayden, brought to us in those of 1874-76 the knowledge of the cliff-dwellers, and they contain among the
miscellaneous publications such papers as W. Matthews’ <i>Ethnography and Philology of the Hidatsa Indians</i>
and W. H. Jackson’s <i>Descriptive Catalogue of photographs of No. Amer. Indians</i>.</p>

<p>There are other governmental documents to be noted: <i>The Exploration of the Red River of Louisiana in
1852</i>, by R. B. Marcy and G. B. McClellan (Washington, 1854), contains a vocabulary of the Comanches and
Witchitas, with some general remarks by W. W. Turner. There is help to be derived from the geographical
details, and from something on ethnology, in the <i>Reports of Explorations and Surveys for a Railroad from
the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean</i> (Washington, 1856-60, in 12 vols.); in W. H. Emory’s <i>Report
on the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey</i> (Washington, 1857-58, in 2 vols.); J. H. Simpson’s
<i>Report of Explorations across the great basin of the territory of Utah in 1859</i> (Washington, 1876); J. N.
Macomb’s <i>Report of the Exploring Expedition from Santa Fé to the Junction of the Grand and Green
Rivers of the Great Colorado of the West in 1859</i> (Washington, 1876).</p>

<p>There were also published, under the auspices of the government, the conglomerate and very unequal work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Henry R. Schoolcraft, <i>Historical and Statistical Information respecting the history, conditions, and prospects
of the Indian Tribes of the United States, collected and prepared under the direction of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs</i> (Philad., 1851-57, in 6 vols., with a trade edition of the same date). An act of Congress
(March 3, 1847) authorized its publication. As reissued it is called <i>Archives of aboriginal knowledge,
containing original papers laid before Congress, respecting the Indian tribes of the United States</i> (Philadelphia,
1860, ’68, 6 vols.). It has the following divisions: General history.&mdash;Manners and customs.&mdash;Antiquities.&mdash;Geography.&mdash;Tribal
organization, etc.&mdash;Intellectual capacity.&mdash;Topical history.&mdash;Physical
type.&mdash;Language.&mdash;Art.&mdash;Religion and mythology.&mdash;Demonology, magic, etc.&mdash;Medical knowledge.&mdash;Condition
and prospects.&mdash;Statistics and population.&mdash;Biography.&mdash;Literature.&mdash;Post-Columbian history.&mdash;Economy
and statistics. An edition of vols. 1-5 (1856) is called <i>Ethnological researches respecting the Red
Men of America, Information respecting the history</i>, etc. The sixth volume is in effect a summary of the
preceding five.<a name="FNanchor_1928_1928" id="FNanchor_1928_1928"></a><a href="#Footnote_1928_1928" class="fnanchor">[1928]</a></p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a committee was charged
with preparing a memorial to Congress, urging action to insure the preservation of certain national monuments.
There is a summary of their report in <i>Science</i>, xii. p. 101.</p>

<p class="p2">Of all European countries, the most has been done in France, by way of periodical system and corporate
organizations, to advance the study of American anthropology, ethnology, and archæology. The <i>Annales des
voyages, de la géographie et de l’histoire, traduits de toutes les langues Européennes; des relations originales,
inédites</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1929_1929" id="FNanchor_1929_1929"></a><a href="#Footnote_1929_1929" class="fnanchor">[1929]</a> the publication of which was begun by Malte-Brun in 1808 and continued to 1814, and the
<i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>, begun in 1819 and continued with a slightly varying title till 1870, are sources
occasionally of much importance. At a later day, Edouard Lartet and others have used the <i>Annales des
Sciences Naturelles</i> as a medium for their publications. We hardly trace here, however, any corporate movement
before the institution of the Société de Géographie de Paris in 1820. In 1824 it issued the first volume
of its <i>Recueil de Voyages et de Mémoires</i>, which reached seven volumes in 1864, and had included (vol. ii.)
an account of Palenqué and the researches of Warden on the antiquities of the United States. Since this
society began the issue of its <i>Bulletin</i> in 1827, it has occasionally given assistance in the study of American
archæology.</p>

<p>The earliest distinctive periodical on the subject was the <i>Revue Américaine</i>, of which, in 1826-27, three
volumes, in monthly parts, were published in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1930_1930" id="FNanchor_1930_1930"></a><a href="#Footnote_1930_1930" class="fnanchor">[1930]</a> In 1857 a movement was inaugurated which engaged
first and last the coöperation of some eminent scholars in these studies, like Aubin, Buschmann, V. A. Malte-Brun,
Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, Jomard, Alphonse Pinart, Cortambert, Léon de Rosny, Waldeck, Abbé
Domenech, Charencey, etc. The active movers were first known as the Comité d’Archéologie Américaine,
and they issued an <i>Annuaire</i> (1863-67) and one volume, at least, of <i>Actes</i> (1865), as well as a collection of
<i>Mémoires sur l’archéologie Américaine</i> (1865). This organization soon became known as the Société Américaine
de France, and under the auspices of this name there has been a series of publications of varying
designation.<a name="FNanchor_1931_1931" id="FNanchor_1931_1931"></a><a href="#Footnote_1931_1931" class="fnanchor">[1931]</a> Its <i>Annuaire</i> began in 1868, and has been continued. The general name of <i>Archives de la
Société Américaine de France</i> covers its other publications, which more or less coincide with the <i>Revue
Orientale et Américaine par Léon de Rosny</i>, the first series of which appeared in Paris in 10 vols., in 1859-65,
followed by a second, the first volume of which (vol. xi. of the whole) is called <i>Revue Américaine, publié
sous les auspices de la Société d’Ethnographie et du Comité d’Archéologie Américaine</i>, and is at the same time
the fourth volume of the <i>Actes de la Société d’Ethnographie Américaine et Orientale</i>. The whole series is
sometimes cited as the <i>Mémoires de la Société d’Ethnographie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1932_1932" id="FNanchor_1932_1932"></a><a href="#Footnote_1932_1932" class="fnanchor">[1932]</a> The series, already referred to, of the <i>Archives
de la Soc. Amér. de France</i> is made up thus: Première série: vol. i., <i>Revue Orientale et Américaine</i>;
ii., <i>Revue Américaine</i>; iii. and iv., <i>Revue Orientale et Américaine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1933_1933" id="FNanchor_1933_1933"></a><a href="#Footnote_1933_1933" class="fnanchor">[1933]</a> The nouvelle série has no sub-titles,
and the three volumes bear date 1875, 1876, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>The student of comparative anthropology will resort to the <i>Materiaux pour l’histoire positive et philosophique</i>
(later <i>primitive et naturelle</i>) <i>de l’homme</i>, the publication of which was begun at Paris in 1864 by
Gabriel de Mortillet, and has been continued by Trutot, Cartailhac, Chautre, and others. This publication
has contained abstracts of the proceedings of an annual gathering in Paris, whose <i>Comptes rendu</i> have been
printed at length as of the <i>Congrès international d’anthropologie et d’archéologie préhistoriques</i> (1865, etc.).<a name="FNanchor_1934_1934" id="FNanchor_1934_1934"></a><a href="#Footnote_1934_1934" class="fnanchor">[1934]</a></p>

<p>Léon de Rosny published but a single volume of a projected series, <i>Archives paléographiques de l’Orient
et de l’Amérique</i> (Paris, 1870-71), which contains some papers on Mexican picture-writing. Rosny and
others, who had been active in the movement begun by the Comité d’Archéologie Américaine, were now instrumental
in organizing the periodical gathering in different cities of Europe, which is known as the <i>Congrès
international des Américanistes</i>. The first session was held at Nancy in 1875, and its <i>Compte Rendu</i>
was published in two volumes (Nancy and Paris, 1876). The second meeting was at Luxembourg in 1877
(<i>Compte Rendu</i>, Paris, 1878, in 2 vols.); the third at Brussels in 1879 (<i>Compte Rendu</i>); the fourth at Madrid
in 1881 (<i>Congreso internacional de Américanistas. Cuarta reunion</i>, Madrid, 1881); the fifth at Copenhagen
(<i>Compte Rendu</i>, Copenhagen, 1884); and others at Chalons-sur-Marne, Turin, and Berlin. The papers
are printed in the language in which they were read.</p>

<p>The <i>Mémoires de la Société d’Ethnographie</i> (founded in 1859) began to appear in 1881, and its third volume
(1882) is entitled <i>Les Documents écrits de l’Antiquité Américaine, compte rendu d’une mission scientifique
en Espagne et en Portugal, par Léon de Rosny, avec une carte et 10 planches</i>. The fourth volume is P. de
Lucy-Fossarieu’s <i>Ethnographie de l’Amérique Antarctique</i> (Paris, 1884). In the second volume of a new
series there is an account by V. Devaux of the work in American ethnology done by Lucien de Rosny as a
preface to a posthumous work<a name="FNanchor_1935_1935" id="FNanchor_1935_1935"></a><a href="#Footnote_1935_1935" class="fnanchor">[1935]</a> of Lucien de Rosny, <i>Les Antilles, étude d’Ethnographie et d’Archéologique
Américaines</i> (Paris, 1886).</p>

<p>Latterly there has been a consolidation of interests among kindred societies under the name of Institution
Ethnographique, whose initial <i>Rapport annuel sur les récompenses et encouragements décernés en 1883</i> was
published at Paris in 1883. This society now comprises the Société d’Ethnographie, Société Américaine de
France, Athénée Oriental, and Société des Etudes Japonaises.</p>

<p class="p2">In England, organized efforts for the record of knowledge began with the creation of the Royal Society,
though certain sporadic attempts had earlier been known. America was represented among its founders in
the younger John Winthrop, and Cotton Mather was a contributor to its transactions, and there has occasionally
been a paper in its publications of interest to American archæologists.<a name="FNanchor_1936_1936" id="FNanchor_1936_1936"></a><a href="#Footnote_1936_1936" class="fnanchor">[1936]</a> The Society of Antiquaries
began to print its <i>Archæologia</i> in 1779 and its <i>Proceedings</i> in 1848, and the American student finds some
valuable papers in them. The British Association for the Advancement of Science began its <i>Reports</i> with
the meeting of 1831, and it has had among its divisions a section of anthropology. In 1830 the Royal Geographical
Society began its <i>Journal</i> with a preliminary issue (1830-31, in 2 vols.), though its regular series
first came out in 1832. Its <i>Proceedings</i> appeared in 1855, and both publications are a conspicuous source in
many ways relating to early American history.<a name="FNanchor_1937_1937" id="FNanchor_1937_1937"></a><a href="#Footnote_1937_1937" class="fnanchor">[1937]</a> Closely connected with its interest has been the publication
begun under the editing of C. R. Markham, and called successively <i>Ocean Highways</i> (1869-73, vol. i.-v.),
with an added title of <i>Geographical Review</i> (1873-74), and lastly as <i>The Geographical Magazine</i> (vol. i.-iii.,
1874-76).</p>

<p>The Ethnological Society published four volumes of a <i>Journal</i><a name="FNanchor_1938_1938" id="FNanchor_1938_1938"></a><a href="#Footnote_1938_1938" class="fnanchor">[1938]</a> between 1844 and 1856, and resuming published
two more volumes in 1869-70. Its contents are mainly of interest in comparative study, though there
are a few American papers, like D. Forbes’s on the Aymara Indians of Peru. This society’s <i>Transactions</i>
was issued in two volumes, 1859-60; and again in seven volumes, 1861-69.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some gentlemen, not content with the restricted field of the Ethnological Society, founded in
London an Anthropological Society, which began the publication of <i>Memoirs</i> (1863-69, in 3 vols.); and in
this publication Bollaert issued his papers on the population of the new world, on the astronomy of the red
man, on American paleography, on Maya hieroglyphics, on the anthropology of the new world, on Peruvian
graphic records,&mdash;not to name other papers by different writers. The <i>Transactions</i> and <i>Journal</i> of the
society, as well as the <i>Popular Magazine of Anthropology</i> (1866), made part in one form or another of the
<i>Anthropological Review</i>, begun in 1863, and discontinued in 1870, when the <i>Journal of Anthropology</i> succeeded,
but ceased the next year. The <i>Proceedings</i> of the society make one volume, 1873-75, under the title
of <i>Anthropologia</i>, and the society also maintained a series of translations of foreign treatises, the first of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
was Theodor Waitz’s <i>Introduction to Anthropology</i>, ed. from the German by J. F. Collingwood (1863); and
this was followed by a version by James Hunt, the president of the society, of Professor Carl Vogt’s <i>Lectures
on Man, his place in Creation and in the history of the Earth</i> (1864), and by other works of Broca, Pouchet,
Blumenbach, etc.</p>

<p>What is known as the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland united some of these separate
endeavors and began its <i>Journal</i> in 1871. The <i>Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</i> has also at times
been the channel by which some of the leading anthropologists have published their views, and a few papers
of archæological import have been given in the <i>Transactions</i> (1884, etc.) of the Royal Historical Society.
Professedly broader relations belong to the <i>Transactions</i> (<i>Comptes rendus</i>) of the International Congress of
prehistoric (anthropology and) archæology, which began its sessions in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_1939_1939" id="FNanchor_1939_1939"></a><a href="#Footnote_1939_1939" class="fnanchor">[1939]</a> The latest summary is the
<i>Archæological Review, a journal of historic and prehistoric antiquities</i>, edited by G. L. Gomme, of which
the first number appeared in March, 1888, which has for a main feature a bibliographical record of past and
current archæological literature.<a name="FNanchor_1940_1940" id="FNanchor_1940_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_1940_1940" class="fnanchor">[1940]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, in the volumes of the Hakluyt Society’s publications, beginning in 1847, in the annotated
reprint of the early writers on American nations and on the European contact with them, that the most
signal service has been done in England to the study of the early history of the new world. They are often
referred to in the present History.</p>

<p class="p2">In Germany a <i>Magazin für die Naturgeschichte des Menschen</i> was published at Zittau as early as 1788-1791.</p>

<p>Wagner published at Vienna, in 1794-96, two volumes of <i>Beiträge zur philosophischen Anthropologie</i>;
and Heynig’s <i>Psychologisches (zugleich Anthropologisches) Magazin</i> was published at Altenburg in 1796-97.</p>

<p>The Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaft began its <i>Abhandlungen</i> in 1804, but it was not till long after
that date that Buschmann and others used it as a channel of their views.</p>

<p>Vertuch’s <i>Archiv für Ethnographie und Linguistik</i> (Weimar, 1807) only reached a single number.</p>

<p>The <i>Zeitschrift für physische Aerzte</i>, which was published by Nasse, at Leipzig, 1818-22, was succeeded
by the <i>Zeitschrift für die Anthropologie</i> (Leipzig, 1823-24), and this was followed by a single volume, <i>Jahrbücher
für Anthropologie</i> (Leipzig, 1830).</p>

<p>Bran’s <i>Ethnographisches Archiv</i> was published at Jena from 1818 to 1829.</p>

<p>It was not till after 1860 that the new interest began to manifest itself, though Fechner’s <i>Centralblatt für
Naturwissenschaften und Anthropologie</i> was published at Leipzig in 1853-54.</p>

<p>Ecker’s <i>Archiv für Anthropologie</i> was published at Braunschweig in 1866-68, which came in 1870 under
the direction of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, which also began
a <i>Correspondenzblatt</i> in 1870, and a series, <i>Allgemeine Versammlung</i>, in 1873. This is the most important
of the German societies.</p>

<p>Bastian’s <i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i> was begun at Berlin in 1869, and later added a <i>Supplement</i>.</p>

<p>The Anthropologische Gesellschaft of Vienna began its <i>Mittheilungen</i> in 1870; and in 1887 the Prähistorische
Commission of the Kais. Akad. der Wissenschaften at Vienna printed the first number of its <i>Mittheilungen</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Verein für Anthropologie</i> in Leipzig published but a single number of a <i>Bericht</i> in 1871.</p>

<p>The Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte continued its <i>Verhandlungen</i>
for 1871-72 only; and the Göttinger Anthropologischer Verein made but a bare beginning (1874) of its <i>Mittheilungen</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Bericht</i> of the Museum für Völkerkunde was begun in Leipzig in 1874.</p>

<p>The Münchener Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte began the publication of
<i>Beiträge</i> in 1876.</p>

<p>In all these publications there have been papers interesting to American archæologists, if only in a comparative
way, and at times American subjects have been frequent, especially in later years. The publications of
zoölogical and geographical societies have in some respects been at times of equal interest, but it has not
been thought worth while to enumerate them.<a name="FNanchor_1941_1941" id="FNanchor_1941_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941_1941" class="fnanchor">[1941]</a></p>

<p>The Königliche Museum at Berlin has a considerable collection of American antiquities, which has been
fostered by Humboldt and others, and the ethnological department has made some important publications like
those relating to <i>Amerika’s Nordwestküste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1942_1942" id="FNanchor_1942_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_1942_1942" class="fnanchor">[1942]</a></p>

<p>Waitz in his <i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i> (vol. iii.; <i>Die Amerikaner</i>, Th. i., Leipzig, 1862) has enumerated
the literature of American anthropology upon which he depended.</p>

<p class="p2">The interest in most of the other European countries is more remotely American. The Museum of Ethnography
at St. Petersburg is not without some objects of interest.<a name="FNanchor_1943_1943" id="FNanchor_1943_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1943_1943" class="fnanchor">[1943]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>In Sweden the Antropologiska Sällskapet of Stockholm began a <i>Tidsskrift</i> in 1875; but it affords little
assistance to the Americanist except in comparative study.<a name="FNanchor_1944_1944" id="FNanchor_1944_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_1944_1944" class="fnanchor">[1944]</a></p>

<p>The student will find some suggestions in a little tract by J. J. A. Worsaae, <i>De l’organisation des musées
historico-archéologiques dans le Nord et ailleurs. Traduit par E. Beauvois</i> (Copenhagen, 1885), which is
extracted from the <i>Mémoires de la société royale des antiquaires de Nord, 1885</i>.</p>

<p>There has begun recently in Leyden an <i>Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie. Herausg. von Krist.
Bahnson, Guido Cora [etc.]</i> (Leiden, 1888).</p>

<p>In Italy the <i>Archivio per l’Antropologia et la Etnologia</i> was begun at Florence in 1871, and was later
made the organ of the Società Italiana di Antropologia di Etnologia. There is an occasional paper in the
<i>Bollettino della Società Geografica Italiana</i>, published at Rome.</p>

<p>In Spain the Sociedad Antropológica Española began at Madrid the publication of its <i>Revista de Antropologia</i>
in 1875.</p>

<p>The session of the Congrès des Américanistes at Madrid in 1881 gave a new life in Spain to the study of
American archæology and history, and out of this impulse there was begun a <i>Biblioteca de los Americanistas,
publícala D. Justo Zaragoza; Editor D. Luis Navarro</i>; and the series has been begun with the <i>Recordacion
florida, discurso del reino de Guatemala</i>, an hitherto unpublished work (1690) of Francisco Antonio de
Fuentes y Guzmán, edited by Justo Zaragoza; and with the <i>Historia de Venezuela</i>, being a third edition of the
work of José de Oviedo y Baños, edited by C. F. Duro.</p>

<p>The Museo Nacional in Mexico has grown to have a proper importance,<a name="FNanchor_1945_1945" id="FNanchor_1945_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_1945_1945" class="fnanchor">[1945]</a> since the Mexican government has
prevented the further exportation of archæological relics. It was founded in 1824 by Fathers Icaza and
Gondra, but it owes its creation largely to the skill of Professor Gumesindo Mendoza, its curator, by whose
death it lost much.<a name="FNanchor_1946_1946" id="FNanchor_1946_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_1946_1946" class="fnanchor">[1946]</a> There is a tendency to draw to it other collections. There was a beginning made to
publish illustrations of the relics in the museum sixty years ago, but it came to little,<a name="FNanchor_1947_1947" id="FNanchor_1947_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947_1947" class="fnanchor">[1947]</a> and it was not until
recently the publication of <i>Anales del Museo Nacional de Méjico</i> was begun that there seemed to be a
proper effort made. The periodicals <i>Revista Mexicana</i> (1835), and <i>Museo Mexicano</i> (1843-45) have done
something to illustrate the subject,&mdash;not to name others of less importance. The principal periodical source
farther south, the <i>Registro Yucatéco</i>, only ran to four volumes, published at Merida in 1845-46.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous archæological repository in South America is that of the National Museum at Rio de
Janeiro, whose published <i>Mémoires</i> contain important contributions to Brazilian Archæology.</p>

<p>&#8258; <i>The editor must be understood as approaching the purely archæological side of the study of Aboriginal
America, as a student of the literature pertaining to it, rather than as a critic of phenomena. He has not
proceeded even in this course without consultation with Professors Putnam, Haynes, and Brinton, with
Mr. Lucien Carr and with Señor Icazbalceta.</i></p>

The book, of which 250 copies only were printed, is rare, and Quaritch prices it at £3 (Sabin, vol. ix. no.
37,447). It preserves some titles which are not otherwise known; and represents a library which Kennett had
gathered for presentation to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Rich (<i>Bibl.
Amer. nova</i>, i. 21) says the index was made by Robert Watts. Although Stevens (Historical Collections,
i. 142) says that the books were dispersed, the library is still in existence in London, though it lacks many
titles given in the printed catalogue, and shows others not in that volume. Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xx.

This collection is also embraced in the Catalogue of the College Library already referred to. Mr. Warden
began the collection of another library, which he used while writing the American part (10 vols.) of the <i>Art de
vérifier des Dates</i>, Paris, 1826-1844, and which (1,118 works) was afterward sold to the State Library at Albany
for $4,000. Dr. Henry A. Homes, the librarian at Albany, informs me that when arranged it made twenty-one
hundred and twenty-three volumes. Warden’s <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>, Paris, 1831, reprinted at Paris in 1840,
is a catalogue of this collection. Mr. Warden died in 1845, aged 67. Cf. Ludewig in the <i>Serapeum</i>, 1845, p.
209; Muller, <i>Books on America</i> (1872), no. 1734; Allibone, iii. 2,579; S. G. Goodrich, <i>Recollections</i>, ii. 243;

This collection was offered to Congress for purchase through Edward Everett in December, 1827. The
printed list, with nearly a hundred entries for manuscripts and three hundred and eighty-nine for printed books,
covering the years 1506-1825, was printed as Document 37 of the 1st session of the 20th Congress. The sale
was not effected. Rich had been able to gather the books at moderate cost because of the troubled political
state of the peninsula. Trübner, <i>Bibliographical Guide</i>, p. xv.</p>

The Humboldt Library was burned in London in June, 1865. Nearly all of the catalogues were destroyed
at the same time; but a few large paper copies were saved, which, being perfected with a new title (London,

by Stevens on Humboldt, in the <i>Journal of Sciences and Arts</i> January, 1870. Various of Humboldt’s

The principal interpreter of the Indian languages of the temperate parts of North America has been
Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, of Hartford, for whose labor in the bibliography of the subject see a chapter in
vol i. of the <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>. There is also a collection edited by him, of books in and upon the
Indian languages, in the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, iii. 123-145. He gave in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the American
Antiquarian Society, and also separately in 1874, a list of books in the Indian languages, printed at Cambridge
and Boston, 1653-1721 (Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 1,571). Cf. also Ludewig’s <i>Literature of American
Aboriginal Languages</i>, mentioned on an earlier page. It was edited and corrected by William W. Turner.
(Cf. <i>Pinart-Brasseur Catalogue</i>, no. 565; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 959).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Icazbalceta published in 1866, at Mexico, a list of the writers on the languages of America; and Romero
made a similar enumeration of those of Mexico, in 1862, in the <i>Boletin de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografia</i>,
vol. viii. Dr. Daniel G. Brinton has made a good introduction to the literary history of the native Americans
in his <i>Aboriginal American Authors</i>, published by him at Philadelphia in 1883. For his own linguistic contributions,
see Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 187, etc. One of the earliest enumerations of linguistic titles
can be picked out of the list which Boturini Benaduci, in 1746, appended to his <i>Idea de una nueva historia
general de la America septentrional</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The most extensive enumeration of the literature of all the North American tongues is doubtless to be the
<i>Bibliography of North American Linguistics</i>, which is preparing by Mr. James C. Pilling of the Bureau of
Ethnology in Washington, and which will be published in due time by that bureau. A preliminary issue (100
copies) for corrections is called <i>Proof-sheets of a Bibliography of the Indian Languages of North America</i>
(pp. xl, 1135).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i> of Leclerc (Paris, 1879) affords many titles to which a preliminary “Table
des Divisions” affords an index, and most of them are grouped under the heading “Linguistique,” p. 537, etc.
The third volume of H. H. Bancroft’s Native Races, particularly in its notes, is a necessary aid in this study;
and a convenient summary of the whole subject will be found in chapter x. of John T. Short’s <i>North Americans
of Antiquity</i>. J. C. E. Buschmann has been an ardent laborer in this field; the bibliographies give his printed
works (Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, p. 208, etc.), and Stargardt’s <i>Catalogue</i> (no. 135, p. 6) shows some of
his manuscripts. The Comte Hyacinthe de Charencey has for some years, from time to time, printed various
minor monographs on these subjects; and in 1883 he collected his views in a volume of <i>Mélanges de philologie
et de paléographie Américaines</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
The Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, in his <i>Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatemalienne</i> (Leclerc, nos. 81, 1,084),
has given for Central America a very excellent list of the works on the linguistics of the natives, which are
all contained also in the <i>Catalogue</i> of the Pinart-Brasseur sale, which took place in Paris in January and
February, 1884. Cf. the paper on Brasseur by Dr. Brinton, in <i>Lippincott’s Magazine</i>, vol. i.; and the
enumeration of his numerous writings in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, ii. 7,420; also Leclerc, Field, and Bancroft.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Dr. Félix C. Y. Sobron’s <i>Los Idiomas de la America Latina,&mdash;Estudios Biografico-bibliograficos</i>, published
a few years since at Madrid, gives, according to Dr. Brinton, extended notices of several rare volumes;
but on the whole the book is neither exhaustive nor very accurate.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
Julius Platzmann’s <i>Verzeichniss einer Auswahl Amerikanischer Grammatiken</i>, etc. (Leipsic, 1876), is
a small but excellent list, with proper notes. These bibliographies will show the now numerous works upon
the aboriginal tongues, their construction and their fruits.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are several important series interesting to the student, which are found in the catalogues. Such
are the <i>Bibliothèque linguistique Américaine</i>, published in seven volumes by Maisonneuve in Paris (Leclerc,
no. 2,674); the <i>Coleccion de linguistica y etnografía Americanas</i>, or <i>Bibliothèque de linguistique et
d’Ethnographie Américaines</i>, 1875, etc., edited by A. L. Pinart; the <i>Library of American Linguistics</i>, in
thirteen volumes, edited by Dr. John G. Shea (Cf. <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, vol. iii. no. 5,631; Field, no. 1,396);
<i>Brinton’s Library of Aboriginal American Literature</i>, published by Dr. D. G. Brinton in Philadelphia; and
Brasseur de Bourbourg’s <i>Collection de documents dans les langues indigènes</i>, Paris, 1861-1864, in four
volumes (cf. Field, p. 175).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The earliest work printed exclusively in a native language was the <i>Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristiana
en lengua Timuiquana</i>, published at Mexico in 1617 (cf. Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 58,580; Finotti, p. 14). This is
the statement often made; but Mr. Pilling refers me to references in Icazbalceta’s <i>Zumárraga</i> (vol. 1. p. 200)
to an earlier edition of about 1547; and in the same author’s <i>Bibliografia Mexicana</i> (p. 32), to one of 1553.
Molina’s <i>Vocabulario de la lengua Castellana y Mexicana</i>, placing the Nahuatl and Castilian in connection,
was printed at Mexico in 1555. The book is very rare, five or six copies only being known; and Quaritch has
priced an imperfect copy at £72 (Quaritch, <i>Bibliog. Géog. linguistica</i>, 1879, no. 12,616; Carter-Brown,
vol. i. no. 206; <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, vol. iii. no, 5,771). The edition of 1571 is also rare (<i>Pinart-Brasseur Catalogue</i>,
no. 630; Carter-Brown, vol. i. nos. 285, 286; Quaritch, 1879, no. 12,617). The first edition of Molina’s
Aztec grammar, <i>Arte de la lengua Mexicana y Castellana</i>, was published the same year (1571). Quaritch
(1879, no. 12,615) prices this at £52 10<i>s.</i> Cf. also Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 284. One of the chief of the
more recent studies of the linguistics of Mexico is Francisco Pimentel’s <i>Cuadro descriptivo y comparativo de
las lenguas indigenas de México</i>, Mexico, 1862-1865; and second edition in 1874-1875.</p>

He says that up to 1881 he had gathered 35,000 volumes, at a cost of $300,000, exclusive of time and

These biographical data are derived from a tract given out by himself which he calls <i>A brief account of
the literary undertakings of Hubert Howe Bancroft</i> (San Francisco, A. L. Bancroft &amp; Co. [his own business
house], 1882, 8vo, pp. 12). Other accounts of his library will be found in the <i>American Bibliopolist</i>, vii. 44;
and in Apponyi’s <i>Libraries of California</i>, 1878. Descriptions of the library and of the brick building (built in
1881) which holds it, and of his organized methods, have occasionally appeared in the <i>Overland Monthly</i> and
in other serial issues of California, as well as in those of the Atlantic cities. He has been free to make public
the most which is known regarding his work. He says that the grouping and separating of his material has
been done mostly by others, who have also written fully one half of the text of what he does not hesitate to call
<i>The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft</i>; and he leaves the reader to derive a correct understanding of the case
from his prefaces and illustrative tracts. Cf. J. C. Derby’s <i>Fifty Years among authors, books, and publishers</i>
(New York, 1884), p. 31.</p>

They appeared in <i>The Nation</i> and in the <i>New York Independent</i> early in 1883. The first aimed to
show that there were substantial grounds for dissent from Mr. Bancroft’s views regarding the Aztec civilization.
The second ignored that point in controversy, and merely proposed, as was stated, to test the “bibliographic
value” which Mr. Bancroft had claimed for his book, and to point out the failures of the index plan and the
vicarious system as employed by him.</p>

The list which is prefixed to the first volume of the <i>History of California</i>, forming vol. xiii. of his
Pacific States series, is particularly indicative of the rich stores of his library, and greatly eclipses the previous
lists of Mr. A. S. Taylor, which appeared in the <i>Sacramento Daily Union</i>, June 25, 1863 and March 13,
1866. Cf. Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, p. xxxix. A copy of Taylor’s pioneer work, with his own corrections,
is in Harvard College Library. Mr. Bancroft speaks very ungraciously of it.</p>

February, 1880, aged eighty years. His father was Robert Lenox, a Scotchman, who began business in
New York in 1783, and retired in 1812 with a large fortune, including a farm of thirty acres, worth then about
$6,000, and to-day $10,000,000,&mdash;if such figures can be made accurate. Cf. also Charles Deane in <i>Amer. Antiq.

Sir Arthur Helps, in referring to the assistance he had got from books sent to him from America, and

be in forming a great library.” <i>Spanish Conquest</i>, American edition, p. 122.</p>

Dr. Trumbull himself has been a keen collector of books on American history, particularly in illustration

The first sale&mdash;there are to be four&mdash;took place in March, 1878, and illustrated a new device in testamentary
bequests. Mr. Brinley devised to certain libraries the sum of several thousand dollars each, to be used
to their credit for purchases made at the public sale of his books. The result was a competition that carried
the aggregate of the sales, it is computed, as much beyond the sum which might otherwise have been obtained,
as was the amount devised,&mdash;thus impairing in no degree the estate for the heirs, and securing credit for
public bequests. The scheme has been followed in the sale of the library (the third part of which was Americana,
largely from the Menzies library) of the late J. J. Cooke, of Providence, with an equivalent appreciation of the
prices of the books. It is a question if the interests of the libraries benefited are advanced by such artificial
stimulation of prices, which a factitious competition helps to make permanent.</p>

The public is largely indebted to the efforts of Mr. Theodore F. Dwight, the librarian and keeper of the
Archives of the Department of State at Washington, for the ultimate success of the endeavor to secure these
manuscripts to the nation. Mr. Stevens had lately (1885) formed a copartnership with his son, Mr. Henry N.
Stevens, and had begun a new series of Catalogues, of which No. 1 gives his own publications, and No. 2 is a
bibliography of New Hampshire History. He died in London, February 28, 1886.</p>

<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1863, p. 203. Dr. Homes, of Albany, is confident Joseph Bumstead was
earlier in Boston than Mr. Drake. The <i>Boston Directory</i> represents him as a printer in 1800, and as a bookseller
after 1816.</p>

His earliest catalogue appeared in 1842, as of his private library. Sabin’s <i>Bibl. of Bibl.</i>, p. xlix. A
collection announced for sale in Boston in 1845 was withdrawn after the catalogue was printed, having been
sold to the Connecticut Historical Society for $4,000. At one time he amassed a large collection of American
school-books to illustrate our educational history. They were bought (about four hundred in all) by the British
Museum.</p>

His catalogues are spiced with annotations signed “Western Memorabilia.” Sabin (<i>Dictionary</i>, vii. 369)
quotes the saying of a rival regarding Gowans’s catalogues, that their notes “were distinguished by much originality,
some personality, and not a little bad grammar.” His shop and its master are drawn in F. B. Perkins’s
<i>Scrope, or the Lost Library</i>. <i>A Novel</i>. Mr. Gowans died in November, 1870, at sixty-seven, leaving a stock,
it is said, of 250,000 bound volumes, besides a pamphlet collection of enormous extent. Mr. W. C. Prime told
the story of his life, genially, in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i> (1872), in an article on “Old Books in New York.” Speaking
of his stock, Mr. Prime says: “There were many more valuable collections in the hands of booksellers, but
none so large, and probably none so wholly without arrangement.” Mr. Gowans was a Scotchman by birth, and
came to America in 1821. After a varied experience on a Mississippi flat-boat, he came to New York, and in
1827 began life afresh as a bookseller’s clerk. Cf. <i>American Bibliopolist</i>, January, 1871, p. 5.</p>

With these canons Mr. Quaritch’s prices can be understood. The extent and character of his stock can
be inferred from the fact that his purchases at the Perkins sale (1873) amounted to £11,000; at the Tite sale
(1874), £9,500; at the Didot sales (1878-1879), £11,600; and at the Sunderland sales (1883), £32,650, out of a
total of £56,851. At the recent sales of the Beckford and Hamilton collections, which produced £86,444, over
one half, or £44,105, went to Mr. Quaritch. These figures enable one to understand how, in a sense, Mr. Quaritch
commands the world’s market of choice books. A sketch, <i>B. Q., a biographical and bibliographical Fragment</i>
(1880, 25 copies), in the privately printed series of monographs issued to a club in London, of which Mr.
Quaritch is president, called “The Sette of Odd Volumes,” has supplied the above data. The sketch is by C.
W. H. Wyman, and is also reprinted in his <i>Bibliography of Printing</i>, and in the <i>Antiquarian Magazine and
Bibliographer</i>, November, 1882. One of the club’s “opuscula” (no. iii.) has an excellent likeness of Mr. Quaritch
prefixed. Cf. also the memoir and portrait in Bigmore and Wyman’s <i>Bibliography of Printing</i>, ii. 230.</p>

The extent of Dr. Dexter’s library is evident from the signs of possession which are so numerously scattered
through the 7,250 titles that constitute the exhaustive and very careful bibliography of Congregationalism
and the allied phases of religious history, which forms an appendix to his <i>Congregationalism as seen in its
Literature</i>, New York, 1880. He explains in the Introduction to his volume the wide scope which he intended
to give to this list; and to show how poorly off our largest public libraries in America are in the earliest books
illustrating this movement, he says that of the 1,000 earliest titles which he gives, and which bear date
between 1546 and 1644, he found only 208 in American libraries. His arrangement of titles is chronological,
but he has a full name-index.</p>

See Vol. IV. p. 12. The editorship is in dispute,&mdash;whether Zorzi or Montalboddo. The better opinion
seems to be that Humboldt erred in assigning it to Zorzi rather than to Montalboddo. Cf. Humboldt, <i>Examen

edition in the Lenox and Carter-Brown libraries, and in the Grenville Library; and one in the Beckford sale,
1882 (no. 186), brought £270. Cf. also <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, no. 2,612[A], and <i>Catalogue de la précicuse bibliothèque
de feu M. le Docteur F. Court</i> (Paris, 1884), no. 262. The <i>Paesi novamente retrovati</i> is shown in the
chapter on the Cortereals in Vol. IV. to be of importance in elucidating the somewhat obscure story of that
portion of the early Portuguese discoveries in North America. Since Vol. IV. was printed, two important contributions
to this study have been made. One is the monograph of Henry Harrisse, <i>Les Cortereal et leur
voyages au Nouveau-monde. D’après des documents nouveaux ou peu connus tirés des archives de Lisbonne et
de Modène. Suivi du texte inédit d’un recit de la troisième expédition de Gasper Cortereal et d’une carte
nautique portugaise de 1502 reproduite ici pour la première jois. Mémoire lu à l’Académie des inscriptions
et belles-lettres dans sa séance du 1er juin, 1883</i>, and published in Paris in 1883, as Vol. III. of the <i>Recueil de
voyages et de documents pour servir à l’histoire de la géographie depuis le XIIIe jusqu’à la fin du XVIe siècle</i>.
The other is the excerpt from the <i>Archivo des Açores</i>, which was drawn from that work by the editor, Ernesto
do Canto, and printed separately at Ponta Delgarda (S. Miguel) in an edition of one hundred copies, under the
title of <i>Os Corte-Reaes, memoria historica accompanhada de muitos documentos ineditos</i>. Do Canto refers
(p. 34) to other monographs on the Portuguese discoveries in America as follows: Sebastião Francisco Mendo
Trigoso,&mdash;<i>Ensaio sobre os Descobrimentos e Commercio dos Portuguezes em as Terras Septentrionaes da
America</i>, presented to the Lisbon Academy (1813), and published in their <i>Memorias da Litteratura</i>, viii. 305.
Joaquim José Gonçalves de Mattos Corrêa,&mdash;<i>Acerca da prioridade das Descobertas feitas pelos portuguezes
nas costas orientaes da America do norte</i>, which was printed in <i>Annaes maritimos e Coloniaes</i>, Lisbon, 1841,
pp. 269-423. Luciano Cordeiro,&mdash;<i>De la part prise par les Portugais dans le découverte de l’Amerique</i>,
Lisbon, 1876. This was a communication made to the Congrès des Américanistes in 1875. Cf. Vol. IV. p. 15.</p>

Richard Eden’s copy of this book, with his annotations, apparently used in making his translation of
1555, was sold in the Brinley sale, no. 40, having been earlier in the Judge Davis sale in 1847 (no. 1,352).

The Sunderland copy (vol. iv. no. 8,179), with the map, brought £24; a French catalogue advertised one
with the map for 250 francs. Without the map it is worth about $25. See further in Vol. III. p. 42; also Murphy,
no. 1,612; Cooke, no. 1,643; Court, no. 17. Hakluyt’s text was used by Lok in making an English version
(he adopted, however, Eden’s text of the first three decades), which was printed as <i>De Novo Orbe; or, the
Historie of the West Indies</i>. Bibliographers differ about the editions. One without date is held by some to
have been printed in 1597 (White-Kennett; Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 1,013; Menzies, no. 1,333, $35;
Huth, p. 923); but others consider it the sheets of the 1612 edition with a new title (see Vol. III. p. 47,
Field, no. 1,014; Stevens, 1870, no. 1,236; Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 10; O’Callaghan, no. 1,481;
Murphy, no. 1,612*; Carter-Brown, vol. i. nos. 129, 130). There are copies of this 1612 edition in the Boston
Athenæum, Harvard College, Carter-Brown, and Massachusetts Historical Society libraries; it is worth from
$30 to $40. Mr. Deane’s edition of 1612 has a dedication to Julius Cæsar, the English jurist of that day,
which is not in the edition without date. See Vol. III. p. 47. The same was reissued as a “second edition,”
with a title dated 1628, of which there is a copy in Harvard College Library (Field, no. 1,015; Stevens,

There are copies of this Basle edition in the Boston Public, Harvard College, Carter-Brown, Lenox,

Sabin (vol. ix. p. 30) says it is rarer than the original Latin. There are copies in Harvard College,

vol. i. no. 110; Huth, vol. iii. nos. 1,050-1,051. Quaritch and others of late price it at £3. It
was from this German edition of the <i>Novus orbis</i> that the collection, often quoted as that of Cornelis
Albyn, and called <i>Nieuwe Weerelt</i>, was made up in 1563, with some additional matter. It is in the dialect of
Brabant, and Muller (<i>Books on America</i>, 1872, no. 1,854) says it is “exceedingly rare, even in Holland;” he
prices it at 50 florins. Cf. Leclerc, no. 2,579 (250 francs); Sabin, vol. ix. no. 34,107; Carter-Brown, vol. i.
no. 240; Huth, vol. iii. no. 1,051; A. R. Smith’s Catalogue (1874), no. 8 (£2 2<i>s.</i>); Pinart, no. 668.</p>

It has pp. 585-600 in addition to the edition of 1532. There are copies in the Cornell University (<i>Sparks
Catalogue</i>, no. 1,107), Lenox, Carter-Brown, Barlow, J. C. Brevoort, and American Antiquarian Society libraries.
One of the two copies in Harvard College Library belonged at different times to Charles Sumner, E. A.
Crowninshield (no. 796), and the poet Thomas Gray, and has Gray’s annotations, and a record that it cost him
one shilling and ninepence. The map of the 1532 Basle edition belongs to this 1537 edition; but it is often
wanting. The <i>Huth Catalogue</i> (vol. iii. p. 1050) calls the map of “extreme rarity;” and Quaritch has pointed
out that the larger names in the map being set in type in the block, there is some variation in the style of these
inscriptions belonging to the different issues. Cf. Sabin, vol. ix. no. 34,103; Harrisse, no. 223; Carter-Brown,
vol. i. no. 123; Leclerc, no. 413, with map (100 francs); Stevens (<i>Nuggets</i>) does not mention the map, but
his <i>Bibliotheca historica</i> (1870), no. 1,455, and <i>Historical Collections</i>, p. 66, give it; Muller (1872), no. 1,850 and
(1877) no. 1,306. Recent prices of good copies with the map are quoted at £4 4<i>s.</i>, 57 marks, and 70 francs;
without the map it brings about $4.00. Grolier’s copy was in the Beckford sale (1882), no. 187.</p>

The editions of Ptolemy recording or affecting the progress of geography in respect to the New World
are noted severally elsewhere in the present work; but the whole series is viewed together in the <i>Bibliography

was issued separately by the University Library in 1884 as no. 18 of its <i>Bibliographical Contributions</i>.</p>

H. H. Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 258. Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 237) gives the date 1541 as apparently
the first edition. His authority is the <i>Labanoff Catalogue</i>; but the date therein is probably an error (Sabin,
vol. xii. no. 51,384). The <i>Athenæ Rauricæ</i> cites a Latin edition of 1543,&mdash;it is supposed without warrant,
though it is also mentioned in Poggendorff’s <i>Biog.-liter. Handwörterbuch</i>, ii. 234.</p>

Also published at Basle (Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 152; Weigel, 1877, <i>Catalogue</i>; Sabin,

The third and later German editions were as follows: 1546. According to the <i>Athenæ Rauricæ</i>.&mdash;1550.
Basle, 1,233 pages, woodcuts, with views of towns added for the first time, and fourteen folios of maps. Harrisse
(no. 294) quotes the description in Ebert’s <i>Dictionary</i>, no. 14,500. Cf. Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,387;
Leclerc, no. 396; Rosenthal (Munich, 1884), no. 52, at 80 marks. Harrisse (<i>Additions</i>, no. 179) says the
Royal Library at Munich has three different German editions of 1550.&mdash;1553. Basle. Muller (<i>Books on
America</i>, 1872, no. 1,020; 1877, no. 2,203) cites a copy, with twenty-six maps; also Sabin (vol. xii. no. 51,388).&mdash;1556.
Cited by Sabin, vol. xii. no. 53,389.&mdash;1561. Basle. Cf. Rosenthal, <i>Catalogue</i> (1884), no. 53.&mdash;1564.
Basle. Cf. Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,390; <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 598. It has fourteen maps, the last being
of the New World.&mdash;1569, 1574, 1578. Basle. All are cited by Ebert and Harrisse, who give them twenty-six
maps, and say that the cuts are poor impressions.&mdash;1574, 1578, 1588. Undated; but cited by Sabin,
vol. xii. no. 51,391-51,393.&mdash;1592, 1598. In these editions the twenty-six maps and the woodcuts are
engraved after new drawings. That of 1592 is in the Boston Athenæum; that of 1598 is in Harvard College
Library. The likeness of Münster on the title is inscribed: “Seins alters lx jar.” America is shown in the
general mappemonde, and in map no. xxvi., “Die Newe Welt.” Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,394-51,395.&mdash;1614,
1628. These Basle editions reproduced the engravings of the 1592 and 1598 editions, and are considered
the completest issues of the German text. They are worth from 30 to 40 marks each. Sabin, vol. xii.
no. 51,396.</p>

The same edition is in the Harvard College Library; but the title varies, and reads thus: <i>Cosmo |

Omniū habitabilis orbis partiū situs, propriæq’ dotes. | Regionum Topographicæ effigies. | Terræ ingenia,

Mense Septemb. Anno Sa | lvtis M.D.LIIII.</i> | This copy belonged to Dr. Mather Byles, and has his autograph;
the title is mounted, and may have belonged to some other one of the several “title-editions” which
appeared about this time. Cf. <i>Harvard University Bulletin</i>, ii. 285; <i>Carter-Brown</i>, vol. i. no. 194; Sabin,
vol. xii. no. 51,380-51,381. The account of America is on pages 1,099-1,113. These editions have been bought
of late years for about $4; but Rosenthal (Munich, 1884) prices a copy of 1552 at 130 marks, and one of 1554
at 150 marks.</p>

That of Basle, 1556, has on pp. 1,353-1,374, “Des nouvelles ilsles: comment, quand et par qui elles ont
esté trouvées,” with a map and fourteen woodcuts. It is usually priced at about $20; the copies are commonly
worn (Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,398). The same publisher, Henry Pierre, reissued it (without date) in 1568, with
twelve folding woodcut maps, the first of which pertains to America (Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 271; Sabin,
vol. xii. no. 51,399). In 1575 a new French edition, with the cuts reduced, was issued in three volumes, folio,
edited by Belleforest and others; it gives 101 pages to America. Cf. Brunet, col. 1,945; <i>Supplément</i>,

Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 46. A list of the Contents is given in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>
(vol. i. p. 181), and in Leclerc (no. 484), where a set (1554, 1583, 1565) is priced at 250 francs. Of interest in
connection with the present History, there are in the first volume of Ramusio the voyages of Da Gama, Vespucius,
and Magellan, as well as matter of interest in connection with Cabot (see Vol. III. p. 24); in the second
volume (1559), the travels of Marco Polo, the voyage of the Zeni and of Cabot. The first edition of the first
volume was published in 1550; Ramusio’s name does not appear. A second edition came out in 1554. Cf.
<i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, nos. 2,096-2,098; Cooke, no. 2,117.</p>

Born in 1485-1486; died in 1557. There is an alleged portrait of Ramusio in the new edition of <i>Il
viaggio di Giovan Leone</i>, etc. (Venice, 1857), the only volume of it published. The portrait of him by Paul
Veronese in the hall of the Great Council was burned in 1557; and Cicogna (<i>Biblioteca Veneziana</i>, ii. 310)
says that the likeness now in the Sala dello Scudo is imaginary.</p>

only from the 1556 edition), which, with a first volume of 1588 and a second volume of 1583, is thought to make
up the most desirable copy; though there are some qualifications in the case, since the 1606 edition of the third
volume is really more complete.</p>

The earliest description of a set of De Bry of any bibliographical moment is that of the Abbé de
Rothelin, <i>Observations et détails sur la collection des voyages</i>, etc. (Paris, 1742), pp. 44 (Carter-Brown, vol. i.
no. 473), which is reprinted in Lenglet du Fresnoy’s <i>Méthode pour étudier la géographie</i> (1768), i. 324.
Gabriel Martin, in his catalogue of the library of M. Cisternay du Fay, had somewhat earlier announced that
collector’s triumph in calling a set in his catalogue (no. 2,825) “exemplum omni genere perfectum,” when his
copy brought 450 francs. The Abbé de Rothelin aimed to exceed Cisternay du Fay, and did in the varieties
which he brought together. The next description was that of De Bure in his <i>Bibliographie instructive</i> (vol. i.
p. 67), printed 1763-1768; but the German editions were overlooked by De Bure, as they had been by his predecessors.
The <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> (vol. i. no. 473) shows Sobolewski’s copy of De Bure with manuscript
notes. A lifetime later, in 1802, A. G. Camus printed at Paris his <i>Mémoire sur les grands et petits voyages</i>
[de De Bry] <i>et les voyages de Thevenot</i>. As a careful and critical piece of work, this collation of Camus was
superior to De Bure’s. A description of a copy belonging to the Duke of Bedford was printed in Paris in 1836
(6 pp.). Weigel, in the <i>Serapeum</i> (1845), pp. 65-89, printed his “Bibliographische Mittheilungen über die
deutschen Ausgaben von De Bry,” which was also printed separately. It described a copy now owned in New
York. Muller, in his <i>Catalogue</i> (1872), p. 217, indicates some differences from Weigel’s collations. The copy
formed by De Bure fell into Mr. Grenville’s hands, and was largely improved by him before he left it, with
his library, to the British Museum. The <i>Bibliotheca Grenvilliana</i> describes it, and Bartlett (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, i. 321) thinks it the finest in Europe. Cf. Dibdin’s description, which is copied in the <i>American
Bibliopolist</i> (1872), p. 13. The standard collation at present is probably that of Brunet, in his <i>Manuel
du libraire</i>, vol. i. (1860), which was also printed separately; in this he follows Weigel for the German texts.
This account is followed by Sabin in his <i>Dictionary</i> (vol. iii. p. 20), whose article, prepared by Charles A.
Cutter, of the Boston Athenæum, has also been printed separately. The Brunet account is accompanied by a
valuable note (also in Sabin, iii. 59), by Sobolewski, whose best set (reaching one hundred and seventy parts)
was a wonderful one, though he lacked the English Hariot. This set came to this country through Muller
(cf. his <i>Catalogue</i>, 1875, p. 387), and is now in the Lenox Library. Sobolewski’s second set went into the
Field Collection, and was sold in 1875; and again in the J. J. Cooke sale (<i>Catalogue</i>, iii. 297) in 1883. Cf.
<i>Catalogue de la collection de feu M. Serge Sobolewski de Moscou</i>, prepared by Albert Cohn. The sale took
place in Leipsic in July, 1873. Brunet and Sobolewski both point out the great difficulties of a satisfactory
collation, arising from the publisher’s habit of mixing the sheets of the various editions, forming varieties
almost beyond the acquisition of the most enthusiastic collector, “so that,” says Brunet, “perhaps no two
copies of this work are exactly alike.” “No man ever yet,” says Henry Stevens (<i>Historical Collections</i>, vol. i.
no. 179), “made up his De Bry perfect, if one may count on the three great De Bry witnesses,&mdash;the Right
Honorable Thomas Grenville, the Russian prince Sobolewski, and the American Mr. Lenox,&mdash;who all went
far beyond De Bure, yet fell far short of attaining all the variations they had heard of.” The collector will
value various other collations now accessible, like that in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, vol. i. no. 396 (also
printed separately, twenty-five copies, in 1875); that printed by Quaritch, confined to the German texts; that
in the <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, ii. 404; and that in the <i>Sunderland Catalogue</i>, nos. 2,052, 2,053.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_202_202" id="Footnote_202_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_202_202"><span class="label">[202]</span></a></span>
There are lists of the sets which have been sold since 1709 given in Sabin (vol. iii. p. 47), from Brunet, and
in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> (vol. i. p. 408). The Rothelin copy, then esteemed the best known, brought, in
1746, 750 francs. At a later day, with additions secured under better knowledge, it again changed hands at 2,551
francs, and once more, in 1855 (described in the <i>Bulletin du bibliophile</i>, 1855, pp. 38-41), Mr. Lenox bought
it for 12,000 francs; and in 1873 Mr. Lenox also bought the best Sobolewski copy (fifty-five volumes) for 5,050
thalers. With these and other parts, procured elsewhere, this library is supposed to lead all others in the facilities
for a De Bry bibliography. Fair copies of the <i>Grands voyages</i> in Latin, in first or second editions, are
usually sold for about £100, and for both voyages for £150, and sometimes £200. Muller, in 1872, held the
fourteen parts, in German, of the <i>Grands voyages</i>, at 1,000 florins. Fragmentary sets are frequently in the
Catalogues, but bring proportionately much less prices. In unusually full sets the appreciation of value is
rapid with every additional part. Most large American libraries have sets of more or less completeness.
Besides those in the Carter-Brown (which took thirty years to make, besides a duplicate set from the Sobolewski
sale) and Lenox libraries, there are others in the Boston Public, Harvard College, Astor, and Long
Island Historical Society libraries,&mdash;all of fair proportions, and not unfrequently in duplicate and complemental
sets. The copy of the Great Voyages, in Latin (all first editions), in the Murphy Library (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 379),
was gathered for Mr. Murphy by Obadiah Rich. The Murphy Library also contained the German text in first
editions. In 1884 Quaritch offered the fine set from the Hamilton Library (twenty-five parts), “presumed
to be quite perfect,” for £670. The Earl of Crawford and Balcarres is about publishing his bibliography of
De Bry.</p>

Reference has been made elsewhere (Vol. III. pp. 123, 164) to sketches, now preserved as a part of the
Grenville copy of De Bry in the British Museum, which seem to have been the originals from which De Bry
engraved the pictures in Hariot’s <i>Virginia</i>, etc. These were drawn by Wyth, or White. A collection of
twenty-four plates of such, from De Bry, were published in New York in 1841 (<i>Field’s Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 1,701). Cf. <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Oct. 20, 1866, for other of De Bry’s drawings in the British Museum.
De Bry’s engravings have been since copied by Picard in his <i>Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses des peuples
idolatres</i> (Amsterdam, 1723), and by others. Exception is taken to the fidelity of De Bry’s engravings in the
parts on Columbus; cf. Navarrete, French translation, i. 320.</p>

The collection, as it is known, is sometimes dated 1644 and 1645, but usually 1646 (Muller, 1872,
no. 1,871; Tiele, <i>Mémoire bibliographique</i>, p. 9; Carter-Brown, vol. ii. nos. 567, 586; Sabin, iv. 315, 316).
A partial English translation appeared in London in 1703 (Muller, 1872, no. 1,886). The <i>Oost-Indische
Voyagien</i>, issued at Amsterdam in 1648 by Joost Hartgers, is a reprint of part of Commelin, with some additions.
Only one volume was printed; but Muller thinks (1872 <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 1877) that some separate issues
(1649-1651), including Vries’s voyage to Virginia and New Netherland, were intended to make part of a second
volume. Cf. Sabin, viii. 118; Stevens, <i>Nuggets</i>, no. 1,339.</p>

Muller (1872), no. 1,884. Another Dutch publication, deserving of a passing notice, which, though not a
collection of voyages, enlarges upon the heroes of such voyages, is the <i>Leeven en Daden der doorluchtigste
Zee-helden</i> (Amsterdam, 1676), by Lambert van den Bos, which gives accounts of Columbus, Vespucius,
Magellan, Drake, Cavendish, the Zeni, Cabot, Cortereal, Frobisher, and Davis. There was a German translation
at Nuremberg in 1681 (Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,149; Stevens, 1870, no. 231).</p>

Pythagoras has left no writings; Aristotle
speaks only of his school; Diogenes Laertius in
one passage (<i>Vitae</i>, viii. 1 (Pythag.), 25) quotes
an authority to the effect that Pythagoras asserted
the earth to be spherical and inhabited
all over, so that there were antipodes, to whom
that is <i>over</i> which to us is <i>under</i>. As all his disciples
agreed on the spherical form of the earth
while differing as to its position and motion, it
is probable that they took the idea of its form
from him. Diogenes Laertius states that Parmenides
called the earth round (<i>στρογγύλη</i>, viii.
48), and also that he spoke of it as spherical
(<i>σφαιροειδῆ</i>, ix. 3); the passages are not, as has
been sometimes assumed, contradictory. The
enunciation of the doctrine is often attributed to
Thales and to Anaximander, on the authority
of Plutarch, <i>De placitis philosophorum</i>, iii. 10, and
Diogenes Laertius, ii. 1, respectively; but the
evidence is conflicting (Simplicius, <i>Ad Aristot.</i>,
p. 506<sup>b</sup>. ed. Brandis; Aristot., <i>De caelo</i>, ii. 13;
Plutarch, <i>De plac. phil.</i> iii., xv. 9).</p>

characters is lavish in his ridicule of the sphericity
of the earth and of the theory of antipodes.

The logical basis of Eratosthenes’s work
was sound, but the result was vitiated by errors
of fact in his assumptions, which, however, to
some extent counterbalanced one another. The
majority of ancient writers who treat of the
matter give 252,000 stadia as the result, but Cleomedes
(<i>Circ. doctr. de subl.</i>, i. 10) gives 250,000.
It is surmised that the former number originated
in a desire to assign in round numbers 700
stadia to a degree. Forbiger, <i>Handbuch der alten
Geographie</i>, i. 180, n. 27.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_268_268" id="Footnote_268_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268_268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a></span>
The stadium comprised six hundred feet, but
the length of the Greek foot is uncertain; indeed,
there were at least two varieties, the Olympic and
the Attic, as in Egypt there was a royal and a common
ell, and a much larger number of supposititious
feet (and, consequently, stadia) have been
discovered or invented by metrologists. Early
French scholars, like Ramé de l’Isle, D’Anville,
Gosselin, supposed the true length of the earth’s
circumference to be known to the Greeks, and
held that all the estimates which have come
down to us were expressions of the same value
in different stadia. It is now generally agreed
that these estimates really denote different conceptions
of the size of the earth, but opinions
still differ widely as to the length of the stadium
used by the geographers. The value selected
by Peschel (<i>Geschichte der Erdkunde</i>, 2d ed., p.
46) is that likewise adopted by Hultsch (<i>Griechische
und Römische Metrologie</i>, 2d ed., 1882) and
Muellenhof (<i>Deutsche Alterthumskunde</i>, 2d ed.,
vol. i.). According to these writers, Eratosthenes
is supposed to have devised as a standard
geographical measure a stadium composed of
feet equal to one half the royal Egyptian ell.
According to Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i>, xii. 14, § 5), Eratosthenes
allowed forty stadia to the Egyptian
schonus; if we reckon the schonus at 12,000
royal ells, we have stadium = 12,000/40 × .525<sup>m</sup>
= 157.5<sup>m</sup>. This would give a degree equal to
110,250<sup>m</sup>, the true value being, according to Peschel,
110,808<sup>m</sup>. To this conclusion Lepsius (<i>Das
Stadium und die Gradmessung des Eratosthenes
auf Grundlage der Aegyptischen Masse</i>, in <i>Zeitschrift
für Aegypt. Sprache u. Alterthumskunde</i>,
xv. [1877]. See also <i>Die Längenmasse der Alten</i>.
Berlin, 1884) objects that the royal ell was never
used in composition, and that the schonus was
valued in different parts of Egypt at 12,000,
16,000, 24,000, <i>small</i> ells. He believes that the
schonus referred to by Pliny contained 16,000
small ells, so that Eratosthenes’s stadium =
<span class="reduct"><sup>16,000</sup>/<sub>40</sub></span> × .450<sup>m</sup> = 180<sup>m</sup>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is possible, however, that Eratosthenes did
not devise a new stadium, but adopted that in
current use among the Greeks, the Athenian stadium.
(I have seen no evidence that the long
Olympic stadium was in common use.) This
stadium is based on the Athenian foot, which,
according to the investigations of Stuart, has
been reckoned at .3081<sup>m</sup>, being to the Roman
foot as 25 to 24. This would give a stadium of
184.8<sup>m</sup>, and a degree of 129,500<sup>m</sup>. Now Strabo,
in the passage where he says that people
commonly estimated eight stadia to the mile,
adds that Polybius allowed 8⅓ stadia to the
mile (<i>Geogr.</i>, vii. 7, § 4), and in the fragment
known as the Table of Julian of Ascalon
(Hultsch, <i>Metrolog. script. reliq.</i>, Lips., 1864, i.
201) it is distinctly stated that Eratosthenes and
Strabo reckoned 8⅓ stadia to the mile. In the
opinion of Hultsch, this table probably belonged
to an official compilation made under the emperor
Julian. Very recently W. Dörpfeld has
revised the work of Stuart, and by a series of
measurements of the smaller architectural features
in Athenian remains has made it appear
that the Athenian foot equalled .2957<sup>m</sup> (instead
of .3081<sup>m</sup>), which is almost precisely the Roman
foot, and gives a stadium of 177.4<sup>m</sup>, which runs
8⅓ to the Roman mile. If this revision is
trustworthy,&mdash;and it has been accepted by Lepsius
and by Nissel (who contributes the article
on metrology to Mueller’s <i>Handbuch der klassischen
Alterthumswissenschaft</i>, Nordlingen, 1886,
etc.),&mdash;it seems to me probable that we have
here the stadium used by Eratosthenes, and that
his degree has a value of 124,180<sup>m</sup> (Dörpfeld,
<i>Beiträge zur antiken Metrologie, in Mittheilungen
des deutschen Archaeolog. Instituts zu Athen</i>, vii.
(1882), 277).</p>

Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> ii. 112, 113. There is apparently
some misunderstanding, either on the part
of Pliny or his copyists, in the subsequent proposition
to increase this estimate by 12,000
stadia. Schaefer’s (<i>Philologus</i>, xxviii. 187) readjustment
of the text is rather audacious. Pliny’s
statement that Hipparchus estimated the circumference
at 275,000 stadia does not agree with
Strabo (i. 4, § 1).</p>

The discrepancy is variously explained. Riccioli,
in his <i>Geographia et hydrographia reformata</i>,
1661, first suggested the more commonly received
solution. Posidonius, he thought, having
calculated the arc between Rhodes and Alexandria
at 1-48 of the circumference, at first assumed
5,000 stadia as the distance between these places:
5,000 × 48 = 240,000. Later he adopted a revised
estimate of the distance (Strabo, ii, ch. v.
§ 24), 3,750 stadia: 3,750 × 48 = 180,000. Letronne
(<i>Mém. de l’Acad. des Inscr. et Belles-Lettres</i>,
vi., 1822) prefers to regard both numbers
as merely hypothetical illustrations of the processes.
Hultsch (<i>Griechische u. Römische Metrologie</i>,
1882, p. 63) follows Fréret and Gosselin in
regarding both numbers as expressing the same
value in stadia of different length (Forbiger,
<i>Handbuch der alten Geographie</i>, i. 360, n. 29).
The last explanation is barred by the positive
statement of Strabo, who can hardly be thought
not to have known what he was talking about:
<i>κἄν τῶν νεωτέρων δὲ ἀναμετρήσεων εἰσάγηται ἡ
ἐλαχίστην ποιόυσα τὴν γῆν, οἵαν ὁ Ποσειδώνιος
ἐγκρίνει περὶ ὀκτωκαίδεκα μυριάδας οὖσαν</i>, (<i>Geogr.</i>,

The domain of early Greek geography has
not escaped the incursions of unbalanced investigators.
The Greeks themselves allowed the
Argonauts an ocean voyage: Crates and Strabo
did valiant battle for the universal wisdom of
Homer; nor are scholars lacking to-day who will
demonstrate that Odysseus had circumnavigated
Africa, floated in the shadow of Teneriffe&mdash;Horace
to the contrary notwithstanding,&mdash;or
sought and found the north pole. The evidence
is against such vain imaginings. The world of
Homer is a narrow world; to him the earth and
the Ægean Sea are alike boundless, and in his
thought fairy-land could begin west of the Lotos-eaters,
and one could there forget the things of
this life. There is little doubt that the author of
the Odyssey considered Greece an island, and
Asia and Africa another, and thought the great
ocean eddied around the north of Hellas to a
union with the Euxine.</p>

he built upon this reconstructed foundation so
impressed Humboldt that he changed his opinion
as to the views of Aristotle on this point
(<i>Examen critique</i>, ii. 373). Such an emendation
is only justifiable by the sternest necessity, and
it has been shown by Ruge (<i>Der Chaldäer Seleukos</i>,
Dresden, 1865), and Prantl (<i>Werke des Aristoteles
uebersetzt und erläutert</i>, Bd. ii.; <i>Die Himmelsgebäude</i>,

consistency requires the change.</p>

The circumnavigation of Africa by Phœnicians
at the command of Necho, though described
and accepted by Herodotus, can hardly be called
an established fact, in spite of all that has been
written in its favor. The story, whether true or
false, had, like others of its kind, little influence
upon the belief in the impassable tropic zone, because
most of those who accepted it supposed that
the continent terminated north of the equator.</p>

Geminus, <i>Isagoge</i>, ch. 13; Achilles Tatius,
<i>Isagoge in Phænom. Arati;</i> Cleomedes, <i>De circulis
sublimis</i>, i. 2. The first two are given in the
<i>Uranologion</i> of Petavius, Lond., Paris, 1630, pp.
56, 155.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The classes were always divided on the same
principle, and each contained two groups so related
that they could apply to one another reciprocally
the name by which the whole class was
designed. These names, however, are not always
applied to the same classes by different writers.
1. The first class embraced the people who lived
in the same half of the same temperate zone;
to them all it was day or night, summer or winter,
at the same time. They were called <i>σύνοικοι</i>
by Cleomedes, but <i>περίοκοι</i> by Achilles Tatius.
2. The second class included such peoples
as lived in the same temperate zone, but were
divided by half the circumference of that zone;
so that while they all had summer or winter at
the same time, the one group had day when the
other had night, and <i>vice versa</i>. These groups
could call one another <i>περίοικοι</i> according to Cleomedes,
but <i>ἀντίχθονες</i> according to Tatius. 3.
The third class included those who were divided
by the torrid zone, so that part lived in the northern
temperate zone and part in the southern,
but yet so that all were in the same half of their
respective zones; <i>i. e.</i>, all were in either the eastern
or western, upper or lower, hemisphere. Day
and night were shared by the whole class at
once, but not the seasons, the northern group
having summer when the southern had winter,
and <i>vice versa</i>. These groups could call one
another <i>ἄντοικοι</i>. 4. The fourth class comprised
the groups which we know as antipodes, dwelling
with regard to one another in different halves
of the two temperate zones, so that they had neither
seasons nor day or night in common, but
stood upon the globe diametrically opposed to
one another. All writers agree in calling these
groups <i>ἀντίποδες</i>. The introduction of the word
<i>antichthones</i> in place of <i>perioeci</i> was due, apparently,
to a misunderstanding of the Pythagorean
<i>antichthon</i>. This name was properly applied to
the imaginary planet invented by the early Pythagoreans
to bring the number of the spheres
up to ten; it was located between the earth and
the central fire, and had the same period of revolution
as the earth, from the outer, Grecian, side
of which it was never visible. This “opposite
earth,” <i>Gegenerde</i>, was later confused with the
other, western, or lower hemisphere of the earth
itself. It was also sometimes applied to the
inhabitants of the southern hemisphere, as by
Cicero in the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i> (i. 28), “duabus
oris distantibus habitabilem et cultum; quarum
altera quam nos incolimus,</p>
<p class="pfn6">Sub axe posita ad stellas septem unde horrifer<br />
Aquiloni stridor gelidas molitur nives,</p>
<p class="pfn4">altera australis, ignota nobis, <i>quam vocant Græci</i>
<i>ἀντίχθονα</i>.” Mela has the same usage (i. 4, 5), as
quoted below. Macrobius, <i>Comm. in Somn. Scip.</i>
lib. ii. 5, uses the nomenclature of Cleomedes.
Reinhardt, quoted in Engelmann’s <i>Bibliotheca
classica Græca</i>, under Geminus, I have not been
able to see.</p>

Antichthones alteram [zonam], nos alteram
incolimus. Illius situs ob ardorem intercedentis
plagae incognitus, huius dicendus est. Haec
ergo ab ortu porrecta ad occasum, et quia sic
iacet aliquanto quam ubi latissima est longior,
ambitur omnis oceano. Mela, <i>Chor.</i>, i. 4, 5. Because
Mela says that the known world is <i>but little</i>
longer than its width, it has been supposed
that he was better informed than his contemporaries,
and attributed something like its real
extent to Africa. Thomassy (<i>Les papes géographiques</i>,
Paris, 1852, p. 17) finds in his work
a rival system to that of Ptolemy. The discovery
of America, he thinks, was due to Ptolemy;
that of the Cape of Good Hope to Mela. It
was the good fortune of Mela that his work was
widely read in the Middle Ages, and had great
influence; but we owe him no new system of
geography, since he simply adopted the oceanic
theory as represented by Strabo and Crates.
That he slightly changed the traditional proportion
between the length and breadth of the
known world is of small importance. The
known world, he states, was surrounded by the
ocean, and there is nothing to show that he supposed
Africa to extend below the equator. In
his description of Africa he applies the terms
length and breadth not as we should, but with
contrary usage: “Africa ab orientis parte Nilo
terminata, pelago a ceteris, brevior est quidem
quam Europa, quia nec usquam Asiae et non
totis huius litoribus obtenditur, longior tamen
ipsa quam latior, et qua ad fluvium adtingit latissima,”
etc., i. 20. (Ed. Parthey, 1867.)</p>

The exposition of Macrobius is so interesting
as illustrating the mathematical and physical
geography of the ancients, and as showing how
thoroughly the practical consequences of the
sphericity of the earth were appreciated; it is so
important in the present connection as demonstrating
that the whole idea of inhabited lands
in other parts of the earth was based on logic
only, not on knowledge, that I have ventured to
quote from it somewhat freely.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Macrobius, <i>Comm. in Somn. Scipionis</i>, ii. 5.&mdash;“Cernis
autem eamdem terram quasi quibusdam
redimitam et circumdatam cingulis, e quibus
duos maxime inter se diversos, et caeli verticibus
ipsis ex utraque parte subnixos, obriguisse pruina

australis ille, in quo qui insistunt, adversa vobis
urgent vestigia, nihil ad vestrum genus; hic
autem alter subjectus aquiloni, quem incolitis,
cerne quam tenui vos parte contingat. Omnis
enim terra, quae colitur a vobis, angusta verticibus,
lateribus latior, parva quaedam insula
est....” (Cicero.) ... Nam et septentrionalis
et australis extremitas perpetua obriguerunt
pruina.... Horum uterque habitationis impatiens
est.... Medius cingulus et ideo maximus,
aeterno afflatu continui caloris ustus, spatium
quod et lato ambitu et prolixius occupavit, nimietate
fervoris facit inhabitabile victuris. Inter
extremos vero et medium duo majores ultimis,
medio minores ex utriusque vicinitatis intemperie
temperantur.... Licet igitur sint hae duae ... quas
diximus temperatas, non tamen ambae

dubium est, nostrum quoque septentrionem [ventum]

rationem calidum pervenire, et austrum corporibus

Eadem ratio nos non permittit ambigere quin

habetur inferior, integer zonarum ambitus quae

habeatur; atque ideo illic quoque eaedem duae
zonae a se distantes similiter incolantur.... Nam
si nobis vivendi facultas est in hac terrarum

aere cujus spiramus haustu, cur non et illic
aliquos vivere credamus ubi eadem semper inpromptu

eamdem credendi sunt spirare auram, quia eadem

temperies. Idem sol illis et obire dicitur nostro
ortu, et orietur quum nobis occidet: calcabunt
aeque ut nos humum, et supra verticem semper

caelum decidant, quum nihil unquam possit ruere
sursum. Si enim nobis, quod asserere genus joci

Mr. Gladstone (<i>Homer and the Homeric age</i>,
vol. iii.) transposes these Homeric localities to
the east, and a few German writers agree with
him. President Warren (<i>True key to ancient
cosmologies</i>, etc., Boston, 1882) will have it that
Ogygia is neither more nor less than the north
pole. Neither of these views is likely to displace
the one now orthodox. Mr. Gladstone is
so much troubled by Odysseus’s course on leaving
Ogygia that he cannot hide a suspicion of
corruption in the text. President Warren should
remember that Ogygia apparently enjoyed the
common succession of day and night. In Homeric
thought the western sea extended northward
and eastward until it joined the Euxine.
Ogygia, located northwest of Greece, would be
the centre, <i>omphalos</i>, of the sea, as Delphi was
later called the centre of the land-masses of the
world.</p>

It is well known that whereas Odysseus
meets the spirits of the dead across Oceanus,
upon the surface of the earth, there is in the
<i>Iliad</i> mention of a subterranean Hades. The
Assyrio-Babylonians had also the idea of an
earth-encircling ocean stream,&mdash;the word <i>Ὠκεανὸς</i>
the Greeks said was of foreign origin,&mdash;and
on the south of it they placed the sea of the
dead, which held the island homes of the departed.
As in the <i>Odyssey</i>, it was a place given

“Furthermore he tolde one thing among all
others, meriting admiration, that certain men
called Meropes dwelt in many cittyes there about,
and that in the borders adiacent to their countrey,
was a perilous place named Anostus, that is
to say, wythout retourne, being a gaping gulfe
or bottomles pit, for the ground is as it were
cleft and rent in sonder, in so much that it openeth
like to the mouth of insatiable hell, y<sup>t</sup> it is
neither perfectly lightsome, nor absolutely darksome,
but that the ayer hangeth ouer it, being
tempered with a certaine kinde of clowdy rednes,
that a couple of floodes set their recourse that
way, the one of pleasure the other of sorow, and
that about each of them growe plantes answearable
in quantity and bignes to a great plaine tree.
The trees which spring by y<sup>e</sup> flood of sorow
yeldeth fruite of one nature, qualitie, and operation.
For if any man taste thereof, a streame
of teares floweth from his eyes, as out of a conduite
pipe, or sluse in a running riuer, yea, such
effect followeth immediately after the eating of
the same, that the whole race of their life is
turned into a tragical lamentation, in so much
that weeping and wayling knitteth their carkeses
depriued of vitall mouing, in a winding sheete,
and maketh them gobbettes for the greedy graue
to swallow and deuoure. The other trees which
prosper vpon the bankes of the floode of pleasure,
beare fruite cleane contrary to the former,
for whosoeuer tasteth thereof, he is presently
weined from the pappes of his auncient appetites
and inueterate desires, &amp; if he were linked in
loue to any in time past, he is fettered in the
forgetfulnes of them, so that al remembrance is
quite abolished, by litle and litle he recouereth
the yeres of his youth, reasuming vnto him by
degrees, the times &amp; seasons, long since, spent
and gone. For, the frowardnes and crookednes
of old age being first shaken of, the amiablenes
and louelynesse of youth beginneth to budde, in
so much as they put on y<sup>e</sup> estate of stripplings,
then become boyes, then change to children,
then reenter into infancie, &amp; at length death
maketh a finall end of all.”</p>

Strabo, vii. 3, § 6. Perizonius makes this passage
in Aelian the peg for a long note on ancient
knowledge of America, in which he brings together
the most important passages bearing on
the subject. He remarks: “Nullus tamen dubito,
quin Veteres aliquid crediderint vel sciverent,
sed quasi per nebulam et caliginem, de
America, partim ex antiqua traditione ab Aegyptiis
vel Carthaginiensibus accepta, partim ex
ratiocinatione de forma et situ orbis terrarum,
unde colligebant, superesse in hoc orbe etiam
alias terras praeter Asiam, Africam, &amp; Europam.”
In my opinion their assumed knowledge
was based entirely on ratiocination, and
was not real knowledge at all; but Perizonius
well expresses the other view.</p>

The average of all known rates of speed
with ancient ships is about five knots an hour;
some of the fastest runs were at the rate of seven
knots, or a little more. Breusing, <i>Nautik der
Alten</i>, Bremen, 1886, pp. 11, 12. Movers, <i>Die
Phœnizier</i>, ii. 3, 190. Movers estimates the rate
of a Phœnician vessel with 180 oarsmen at
double that of a Greek merchantman. He compares
the sailing qualities of Phœnician vessels
with those of Venice in the Middle Ages to the
disadvantage of the latter. As the ancients had
nothing answering to our log, and their contrivances
for time-keeping were neither trustworthy
nor adapted for use on shipboard, these estimates
are necessarily based on a few reports of
the number of days spent on voyages of known
length,&mdash;a rather uncertain method.</p>

The narration of Hanno’s voyage has been
preserved, apparently in the words of the commander’s
report. <i>Geographi Graeci minores</i>,
ed. Mueller (Paris, 1855), i. pp. 1-14. Cf. also
<i>Prolegom.</i>, pp. xviii, xxiii. Our only notion of
the date of the expedition is derived from Pliny,
<i>Hist. Nat.</i>, v. i. § 7, who says: “Fuere et
Hannonis Carthaginiensium ducis commentarii,
<i>Punicis rebus florentissimis</i> explorare ambitum
Africae jussi.” All that is known of Himilko
is derived from the statement of Pliny, <i>Hist.
Nat.</i>, ii. 67, that he was sent at about the same
time as Hanno to explore the distant regions of
Europe; and from the poems of Avienus, who
wrote in the fourth century, and professed to
give, in the <i>Ora Maritima</i>, many extracts from
the writings of Himilko. The description of
the difficulties of navigation in the Atlantic is
best known. In his <i>Deutsche Alterthumskunde</i>
(Berlin, 1870), i. pp. 73-210, Muellenhof has devoted
especial attention to an analysis of this
record.</p>

from Atlantes or Americans, but from
the Quaternary men of Cro-magnon on the

brachycephalic race in Gomera.</p>

In the second century, a.d., Pausanias
(<i>Desc. Graec.</i>, i. 23) was told by Euphemus, a
Carian, that once, on a voyage to Italy, he had
been driven to the sea outside [<i>ἐς τὲν ἔξω θάλασσαν</i>],
where people no longer sailed, and where
he fell in with many desert islands, some inhabited
by wild men, red-haired, and with tails,
whom the sailors called Satyrs. Nothing more is
known of these islands. <i>Ἔξο</i> has here been rendered
simply “distant”; but even in this sense
it could hardly apply in the time of Pausanias to
any region but the Atlantic. It is more probable
that the phrase means “outside the columns.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the first century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, some men of an unknown
race were cast by the sea on the German
coast. There is nothing to show that these men
were American Indians; but since that has been
sometimes assumed, the matter should not be passed
over here. The event is mentioned by
Mela (<i>De Chorogr.</i>, iii. 5, § 8), and by Pliny (<i>Hist.
Nat.</i>, ii. 67); the castaways were forwarded to
the proconsul, Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
62), by the king of the tribe within whose territory
they were found. Pliny calls the tribe the
Suevi; the reading in Mela is very uncertain.
Parthey has <i>Botorum</i>, the older editors <i>Baetorum</i>,
or <i>Boiorum</i>. The Romans took them for
inhabitants of India, who had been carried
around the north of Europe; modern writers
have seen in them Africans, Celts, Lapps, or
Caribs. A careful study of the whole subject,
with references to the literature, will be found
in an article by F. Schiern: <i>Un énigme ethnographique
de l’antiquité</i>, contributed to the Memoirs
of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries;
New Series, 1878-83, pp. 245-288.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the Louvre is an antique bronze which has
been thought to represent one of the Indians of
Mela, and also to be a good reproduction of the
features of the North American Indian (Longpérier,
<i>Notice des bronzes antiques</i>, etc., <i>du Musée
du Louvre</i>, Paris, 1868, p. 143), but the supposition
is purely arbitrary.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Such an event as an involuntary voyage from
the West Indies to the shores of Europe is not
an impossibility, nor is the case cited by Mela
and Pliny the only one of the kind which we find
recorded. Gomara (<i>Hist. gen. de las Indias</i>, 7)
says some savages were thrown upon the German
coast in the reign of Frederic Barbarossa
(1152-1190), and Aeneas Silvius (Pius II.) probably
refers to the same event when he quotes a
certain Otho as relating the capture on the coast
of Germany, in the time of the German emperors,
of an Indian ship and Indian traders (mercatores).
The identity of Otho is uncertain.
Otto of Freisingen ([Dagger] 1158) is probably meant,
but the passage does not appear in his works
that have been preserved (Aeneas Silvius, <i>Historia
rerum</i>, ii. 8, first edition, Venice, 1477).
The most curious story, however, is that related
by Cardinal Bembo in his history of Venice (first
published 1551), and quoted by Horn (<i>De orig.
Amer.</i>, 14), Garcia (iv. 29), and others. It deserves,
however, record here. “A French ship
while cruising in the ocean not far from Britain
picked up a little boat made of split oziers and
covered with bark taken whole from the tree;
in it were seven men of moderate height, rather
dark complexion, broad and open faces, marked
with a violet scar. They had a garment of fishskin
with spots of divers shades, and wore a
headgear of painted straw, interwoven with seven
things like ears, as it were (coronam e culmo
pictam septem quasi auriculis intextam). They
ate raw flesh, and drank blood as we wine. Their
speech could not be understood. Six of them
died; one, a youth, was brought alive to Roano
(so the Italian; the Latin has Aulercos), where
the king was” (Louis XII.). Bembo, <i>Rerum
Venetarum Hist.</i> vii. year, 1508. [<i>Opere</i>, Venice,
1729, i. 188.]</p>

“He [Eratosthenes] says that if the extent
of the Atlantic Ocean were not an obstacle, we
might easily pass by sea from Iberia to India,
still keeping in the same parallel, the remaining
portion of which parallel ... occupies more
than a third of the whole circle.... But it is
quite possible that in the temperate zone there
may be two or even more habitable earths <i>οἰκουμένας</i>,
especially near the circle of latitude
which is drawn through Athens and the Atlantic
ocean.” (Strabo, <i>Geogr.</i>, i. 4, § 6.)</p>

Seneca, <i>Naturalium Quaest. Praefatio.</i> The
passage is certainly striking, but those who, like
Baron Zach, base upon it the conclusion that
American voyagers were common in the days of
Seneca overestimate its force. It is certainly
evident that Seneca, relying on his knowledge of
theoretical geography, underestimated the distance
to India. Had the length of the voyage to
America been known, he would not have used
the illustration.</p>

Smaller vessels even than were then afloat
have crossed the Atlantic, and the passage from
the Canaries is hardly more difficult than the
Indian navigation. The Pacific islanders make
voyages of days’ duration by the stars alone to
goals infinitely smaller than the broadside of
Asia, to which the ancients would have supposed
themselves addressed.</p>

In the first book of his <i>Suasoriæ</i>, M. Annaeus
Seneca collected a number of examples
illustrative of the manner in which several of
the famous orators and rhetoricians of his time
had handled the subject, <i>Deliberat Alexander,
an Oceanum naviget</i>, which appears to have been
one of a number of stock subjects for use in
rhetorical training. This collection thus gives
a good view of the prevalent views about the
ocean, and certainly tells strongly against the idea
that the western passage was then known or practised.
“Fertiles in Oceano jacere terras, ultraque
Oceanum rursus alia littora, alium nasci
orbem, ... <i>facile ista finguntur; quia Oceanus
navigari non potest</i> ... confusa lux alta caligine,
et interceptus tenebris dies, ipsum veros grave et
devium mare, et aut nulla, aut ignota sidera. Ita
est, Alexander, rerum natura; <i>post omnia Oceanus,
post Oceanum nihil</i>.... Immensum, et humanae
intentatum experientiae pelagus, totius
orbis vinculum, terrarumque custodia, inagitata
remigio vastitas.... Fabianus ... divisit enim
illam [quaestionem] sic, ut primum negaret ullas
in Oceano, aut trans Oceanum, esse terras habitabiles:
deinde si essent, perveniri tamen ad illas
non posse. Hic difficultatem ignoti maris,
naturam non patientem navigationis.”</p>

Virgil, bishop of Salzburg, was accused before
Pope Zacharias by St. Boniface of teaching
the doctrine of antipodes; for this, and not for
his belief in the sphericity of the earth (as I read),
he was threatened by the Pope with expulsion
from the church. The authority for this story is
a letter from the Pope to Boniface. See Marinelli,
<i>Die Erdkunde bei den Kirchenvätern</i>,

Cosmas, as will be seen in the cut, adhered
to the continental theory, placing Paradise on

It has been suggested by M. Beauvois that
Labrador may in the same way derive its name
from <i>Inis Labrada</i>, or the Island of Labraid,
which figures in an ancient Celtic romance. The
conjecture has only the phonetic resemblance to
recommend it. Beauvois, <i>L’Elysée transatlantique

The result of the Arabian measurements
gave 56⅔3 miles to a degree. Arabian miles were
meant, and as these contain, according to Peschel
(<i>Geschichte der Geographie</i>, p. 134) 4,000
ells of 540.7<sup>mm</sup>., the degree equalled 122,558.6<sup>m</sup>.
The Europeans, however, thought that Roman

The tract <i>On the World</i> (<i>περὶ κόσμου</i>, de
mundo), and the <i>Strange Stories</i> (<i>περὶθαυμασίων
ἀκουσμάτν</i>, <i>de mirabilibus auscultationibus</i>),
printed with the works of Aristotle, are held to
be spurious by critics: the former, which gives a
good summary of the oceanic theory of the distribution
of land and water (ch. 3), is considerably
later in date; the latter is a compilation
made from Aristotle and other writers. Muellenhof
has sought partially to analyze it in his

<i>Strabonis Geographia</i> (Romae, Suweynheym
et Pannartz, s. a.), in 1469 or 1470, folio.
First edition of the Latin translation which was
made by Guarini of Verona, and Lilius Gregorius
of Tiferno; only 275 copies were printed.
It was reprinted in 1472 (Venice), 1473 (Rome),
1480 (Tarvisii), 1494 (Venice), 1502 (Venice),
1510 (Venice), and 1512 (Paris). <i>Strabo de situ
orbis</i> (Venice. Aldus et Andr. Soc., 1516), fol.,
was the first Greek edition; a better edition appeared
in 1549 (Basil., fol.), with Guarini’s and
Gregorius’s translation revised by Glareanus
and others. Critical ed. by J. Kramer (Berlin,
1844), 3 vols. Ed. with Latin trans. by C.
Müller and F. Dübner (Paris, Didot, 1853, 1857).
It has since been edited by August Meineke
(Leipsic, Teubner, 1866. 3 vols. 8vo).</p>
<p class="pfc4">There was an Italian translation by Buonacciuoli,
in Venice and Ferrara, 1562, 1585. 2 vols.
The <i>Γεωγραφικὰ</i> has been several times translated
into German, by Penzel (Lemgo, 1775-1777,
4 Bde. 8vo), Groskund (Berlin, Stettin,
1831-1834. 4 Thle.), and Forbiger (Stuttgart,
1856-1862. 2 Bde.), and very recently into English
by H. C. Hamilton and W. Falconer (London,
Bell [Bohn], 1887). 3 vols. This has a
useful index.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The great French translation of Strabo, made
by order of Napoleon, with very full notes by
Gosselin and others, is still the most useful translation:
<i>Géographie du Strabon trad. du grec en
française</i> (Paris, 1805-1819). 5 vols. 4to.</p>

The Geography was first printed, in a Latin
translation, at Vincentia, in 1475; the date 1462
in the Bononia edition being recognized as a
misprint, probably for 1482. The history of the
book has been described by Lelewel in the appendix
to his <i>Histoire de la Géographie</i>, and more
fully in Winsor’s <i>Bibliography of Ptolemy’s Geography</i>
(Cambridge, Mass., 1884), and in the section
on Ptolemy by Wilberforce Eames in Sabin’s
<i>Dictionary</i>, also printed separately.</p>

The <i>Phaenomena</i> of Aratus was a poem
which had great vogue both in Greece and Rome.
It was commented upon by Hipparchus and

of Petavius), and translated by Cicero.</p>

1534. There is an English translation by Thomas
Taylor, <i>The Commentaries of Proclus on the Timaeus

was also the author of astronomical works
which helped to keep Grecian learning alive in
the early Middle Ages.</p>

great <i>Atlas</i> of mediæval maps issued by Santarem,

from the MS. not elsewhere found; Siegmund
Günther’s <i>Die Lehre von der Erdrundung u.
Erdbewegung im Mittelalter bei den Occidentalen</i>
(Halle, 1877), pp. 53, and his <i>Die Lehre von der
Erdrundung u. Erdbewegung bei den Arabern
und Hebräern</i> (Halle, 1877), pp. 127, give numerous
bibliographical references with exactness.
Specially interesting is Charles Jourdain’s <i>De
l’influence d’Aristote et de ses interprètes aux la
découverte du nouveau monde</i> (Paris, 1861), where
we read (p. 30): “La pensée dominante de Colomb
était l’hypothèse de la proximité de l’Espagne
et de l’Asie, et ... cette hypothèse lui venait
d’Aristote et des scolastiques;” and again
(p. 24): “Ce n’est pas à Ptolémée ... que le
moyen âge a emprunté l’hypothèse d’une communication
entre l’Europe et l’Asie par l’océan Atlantique....
Cette conséquence, qui n’avait par
éschappé à Eratosthène, n’est pas énoncée par
Ptolémée tandis qu’elle retrouve de la manière
la plus expresse chez Aristote.”</p>

Ctesias, <i>On India</i>, ch. v. (ed. Didot, p. 80), says the
rising sun appears ten times larger in India than in Greece.
Strabo, <i>Geogr.</i> iii. 1, § 5, quotes Posidonius as denying a
similar story of the setting sun as seen from Gades.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Whether Herodotus had a similar idea when he wrote
that in India the mornings were torrid, the noons temperate
and the evenings cold (Herod. iii. 104), is uncertain. Also
see Dionysius Periegetes, <i>Periplus</i>, 1109-1111, in <i>Geographi
Graeci minores</i>. <i>Ed. C. Mueller</i> (Paris, Didot, 1861, ii.

that Homer thought the earth cylindrical, but it may be
doubted if the expression means more than an outburst of
joy at returning from the darkness beyond ocean to the

Perizonius, in his note to the story of Silenus and
Midas, quoted from Theopompus by Ælian in his <i>Varia
Historiæ</i> (Rome, 1545; in Latin, Basle, 1548; in English,
1576), quotes the chief references in ancient writers. Cf.
Ælian, ed. by Perizonius, Lugd. Bat. 1701, p. 217. Among
the writers of the previous century quoted by this editor are
Rupertus, <i>Dissertationes mixtæ, ad Val. Max.</i> (Nuremberg,
1663). Math. Berniggerus, <i>Ex Taciti Germaniâ
et Agricolâ questiones</i> (Argent. 1640). Eras. Schmidt,
<i>Dissert. de America</i>, which is annexed to Schmidt’s ed.
of Pindar (Witelsbergæ, 1616), where it is spoken of as
“Discursus de insula Atlantica ultra columnas Herculis
qua America hodie dicitur.” Cluverius, <i>Introduction in
univers. geogr.</i>, vi. 21, § 2, supports this view, 1st ed.,
1624. In the ed. 1729 is a note by Reiskius on the same
side, with references (p. 667).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the same century is J. D. Victor’s <i>Disputatio de
America</i> (Jenæ, 1670).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Brunn’s <i>Bibliotheca Danica</i> are a number of titles

Gaffarel has since elaborated this part of the book in
some papers, “Les Grecs et les Romains ont-ils connu
l’Amérique?” in the <i>Revue de Géographie</i> (Oct. 1881, <i>et

theories, and voyages.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are references in Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i>, v.

<i>No. Amer. of Antiq.</i>, 146, 466, 474; in DeCosta’s <i>Precolumbian

introduction to his <i>Landa’s Relation</i>; Charles Jourdain, in
his <i>De l’influence d’Aristote et de ses interprètes sur la
découverte du nouveau monde</i> (Paris, 1861), taken from
the <i>Journal de l’Instruction Publique</i>. A recent book,
W. S. Blackett’s <i>Researches</i>, etc. (Lond. 1883), may be
avoided.</p>

discussion of Humboldt, Brasseur (<i>Nat. Civ.</i>), Gaffarel
(<i>Rapport</i>), De Costa, etc., of course helps the investigator
to clues.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The subject is mixed up with some absurdity and deceit.
The Dighton Rock has passed for Phœnician (Stiles’
<i>Sermon</i>, 1783; Yates and Moulton’s <i>New York</i>). At one
time a Phœnician inscription in Brazil was invented (<i>Am.
Geog. Soc. Bull.</i> 1886, p. 364; St. John V. Day’s <i>Prehistoric
Use of Iron</i>, Lond. 1877, p. 62). The notorious
Cardiff giant, conveniently found in New York state, was
presented to a credulous public as Phœnician (<i>Am.
Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Ap. 1875). The history of this hoax is
given by W. A. McKinney in the <i>New Englander</i>, 1875,
P. 759.</p>

Ammianus Marcellinus (xv. 9) quotes from Timagenes
(who wrote in the first century a history of Gaul, now lost)
a statement that some of the Gauls had originally immigrated
from very distant islands and from lands beyond the
Rhine (<i>ab insulis extimis</i> confluxisse et tractibus transrhenanis)
whence they were driven by wars and the incursions
of the sea (Timag. in Mueller, <i>Frag. hist. of Graec.</i>, iii.
323). It would seem incredible that this should be dragged
into the Atlantis controversy, but such has been the case.</p>

more or less urged in Heer’s <i>Flora Tertiaria Helveticae</i>

His work is much more than a defence of Plato. He
attempts to show that Atlantis was the terrestrial paradise,
the cradle of the world’s civilization. I suppose it was
his book which inspired Mrs. J. Gregory Smith to write
<i>Atla: a Story of the Lost Island</i> (New York, 1886).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Donnelly’s book was favorably reviewed by Prof. Winchell
(“Ancient Myth and Modern Fact,” <i>Dial</i>, Chicago,
April, 1882, ii. 284), who declared that there was no longer
serious doubt that the story was founded on fact. His
theory was enthusiastically adopted by Mrs. A. A. Knight
in <i>Education</i> (v. 317), and somewhat more soberly by Rev.
J. P. McLean in the <i>Universalist Quarterly</i> (Oct., 1882,
xxxix. 436, “The Continent of Atlantis”). I have not
seen an article in <i>Kansas Review</i> by Mrs. H. M. Holden,
quoted in <i>Poole’s Index</i> (<i>Kan. Rev.</i>, viii. 435; also, viii.
236, 640). It was more carefully examined and its claims
rejected by a writer in the <i>Journal of Science</i> (London),
(“Atlantis once more,” June, 1883; xx. 319-327). W. F.
Poole doubts whether Mr. Donnelly himself was quite serious
in his theorizing (“Discoveries of America: the lost
Atlantis theory,” <i>Dial</i>, Sept., 1884, v. 97). Lord Arundel
of Wardour controverted Donnelly in <i>The Secret of Plato’s
Atlantis</i> (London, 1885), and believes that the Atlantis
fable originated in vague reports of Hanno’s voyage&mdash;a
theory hardly less remarkable than the one it aims to displace.
Lord Arundel’s book was reviewed in the <i>Dublin
Review</i> (Plato’s “Atlantis” and the “Periplus” of Hanno),
July, 1886, xcix. 91.</p>

<i>The discoveries of America to the year 1525</i> (New

quoted above, for some healthy criticism of this kind of
writing (<i>Dial</i>, v. 97). Also a notice in the <i>Nation</i>, July 31,
1884.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The scientific theory of Atlantis is, I believe, supported
by M. Jean d’Estienne in the <i>Revue des Questiones Scientifiques</i>,
Oct., 1885, and by M. de Marçay, <i>Histoire des
descouvertes et conquêtes de l’Amerique</i> (Limoges, 1881),
but I have seen neither. H. H. Howorth, <i>The Mammoth
and the Flood</i> (London, 1887), is struggling to revive the
credit of water as the chief agent in the transformations of
the earth’s surface, and relies much upon the deluge myths,
but refuses to accept Atlantis. He thinks the zoölogic evidence
proves the existence in pleistocene times of an easy
and natural bridge between Europe and America, but sees
no need of placing it across the mid-Atlantic (p. 262).</p>

The position of these islands and the fact that the
Arabs believed that they were following Ptolemy in placing
in them the first meridian seems almost conclusive in favor
of the Canaries; but M. D’Avezac is inclined in favor of
the Azores, because the Arabs place in the Eternal Isles
certain pillars and statues warning against further advance
westward, which remind him of the equestrian statues of
the Azores, and because Ebn Sáyd states that the Islands
of Happiness lie between the Eternal Islands and Africa.</p>

Humboldt (<i>Examen Critique</i>, ii. 172) quotes these
islands from Sanuto Torsello (1306). They appear on a
map of about 1350, preserved in St. Mark’s Library at
Venice (Wuttke, in <i>Jahresber. d. Vereins für Erdkunde
zu Dresden</i>, xvi. 20), as “<i>I fortunate I beate, 368,</i>” in
connection with <i>La Montagne de St. Brandan</i>, west of
Ireland. They are also in the Medicean Atlas of 1351, and
in Fra Mauro’s map and many others.</p>

M. Buache in his <i>Mémoire sur l’Isle Antillia</i> (<i>Mém.
Inst. de France, Sciences math. et phys.</i>, vi., 1806), read
on a copy of the Pizigani map of 1367, sent to him from
Parma, the inscription, <i>Ad ripas Antilliae or Antullio</i>.
Cf. Buache’s article in German in <i>Allg. Geogr. Ephemeriden</i>,
xxiv. 129. Humboldt (<i>Examen</i>, ii. 177) quotes Zurla
(<i>Viaggi</i>, ii. 324) as denying that such an inscription can be
made out on the original: but Fischer (<i>Sammlung von
Welt-karten</i>, p. 19) thinks this form of the name can be
made out on Jomard’s fac-simile. Wuttke, however, thinks
that the word Antillia is not to be made out, and gives the
inscription as <i>Hoc sont statua q fuit ut tenprs A cules</i>,
and reads <i>Hoc sunt statuae quae fuerunt antea temporibus
Arcules = Herculis</i> (Wuttke, <i>Zur Geschichte der Erdkunde
in der letzten Haelfte des Mittelalters</i>, p. 26, in <i>Jahresbericht
des Vereins für Erdkunde zu Dresden</i>, vi. and vii.,
1870). The matter is of interest in the story of the equestrian
statue of Corvo. According to the researches of
Humboldt, this story first appears in print in the history
of Portugal by Faria y Sousa (<i>Epitome de las historias
Portuguezas</i>, Madrid, 1628. <i>Historia del Reyno de Portugal</i>,
1730), who describes on the “Mountain of the
Crow,” in the Azores, a statue of a man on horseback
pointing westward. A later version of the story mentions
a western promontory in <i>Corvo</i> which had the form of a
person pointing westward. Humboldt (ii. 231), in an interesting
sketch, connects this story with the Greek traditions
of the columns of Hercules at Gades, and with the old
opinion that beyond no one could pass; and with the curious
Arabic stories of numberless columns with inscriptions
prohibiting further navigation, set up by <i>Dhoulcarnain</i>, an
Arabian hero, in whose personality Hercules and Alexander
the Great are curiously compounded (see <i>Edrisi</i>). Humboldt
quotes from Buache a statement that on the Pizigani
map of 1367 there is near Brazil (Azores) a representation
of a person holding an inscription and pointing westward.</p>

Peter Martyr, in 1493, states that cosmographers had
determined that Hispaniola and the adjacent isles were
<i>Antillae insulae</i>, meaning doubtless the group surrounding
Antillia on the old maps (<i>Decades</i>, i. p. 11, ed. 1583);
but the name was not popularly applied to the new islands
until after Wytfliet and Ortelius had so used it (Humboldt,
<i>Examen</i>, ii. 195, etc.). But Schöner, in the dedicatory
letter of his globe of 1523, says that the king of Castile
through Columbus has discovered <i>Antiglias Hispaniam
Cubam quoque</i> (Stevens, <i>Schöner</i>, London, 1888, fac-simile
of letter). In the same way the name Seven Cities was
applied to the pueblos of New Mexico by their first discoverers,
and Brazil passed from an island to the continent.</p>

The Bianco map of 1436 has, on the ocean sheets, five
groups of small islands, from south to north: (1) Canaries;
(2) Madeira and Porto Santo; (3) <i>luto</i> and <i>chapisa</i>; (4) <i>d.
brasil, di colonbi, d. b. ntusta, d. sanzorzi</i>; (5) <i>coriios</i> and
<i>corbo marinos</i>; (6) <i>de ventura</i>; (7) <i>de brazil</i>. West of
the third and fourth lies <i>Antillia</i>, and N. W. of the fifth a
corner of <i>de laman satanaxio</i>, while west of six and seven
are numerous small islands unnamed. On the ocean sheet
of the Bianco of 1448, we have (2) Madeira and Porto
Santo; (3) <i>licongi</i> and <i>coruo marin</i>; (4) <i>de braxil, zorzi</i>,
etc.; (5) <i>coriios</i> and <i>coruos marinos</i>; (6) <i>y. d. mam
debentum</i>; (7) <i>y. d. brazil d. binar</i>. There is no Antillia
and no Satanaxio, but west of (3) and (4) are two other
groups: (1) <i>yd. diuechi marini, y de falconi</i>; (2) <i>y fortunat
de s<sup>o</sup>. beati. blandan, dinferno, de ipauion, beta

Of these collections, those of Kunstmann and Jomard
are not uncommon in the larger American libraries. A set
of the Santarem series is very difficult to secure complete,
but since the description of these collections in Vol. II.
was written, a set has been secured for Harvard College
library, and I am not aware of another set being in this
country. The same library has the Ongania series. The
maps in this last, some of which are useful in the present
study, are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">1. Arabic marine map, xiiith cent. (Milan); 2. Visconte,
1311 (Florence); 3. Carignano, xivth cent. (Florence);

16. Cantino, 1501-3 (Modena). This has not been
issued in this series, but Harrisse published a fac-simile in
colors in connection with his <i>Les Corte-Real</i>, etc., Paris,
1883. 17. Agnese, 1554 (Venice). The names on these
photographs are often illegible; how far the condition of
the original is exactly reproduced in this respect it is of
course impossible to say without comparison.</p>

Lelewel (ii. 119) gives a long account of Sanuto and his

communication was impossible.</p>

It has sometimes been contended that a
bull of Gregory IV, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 770, referred to
Greenland, but Spitzbergen was more likely intended,
though its known discovery is much
later. A bull of <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 835, in Pontanus’s <i>Rerum
Daniarum Historia</i>, is also held to indicate
that there were earlier peoples in Greenland
than those from Iceland. Sabin (vi. no. 22,854)
gives as published at Godthaab, 1859-61, in 3
vols., the Eskimo text of Greenland Folk Lore,
collected and edited by natives of Greenland,
with a Danish translation, and showing, as the
notice says, the traditions of the first descent of
the Northmen in the <i>eighth</i> century.</p>

An apocryphal story goes that one of these
churches was built near a boiling spring, the water
from which was conducted through the building
in pipes for heating it! The Zeno narrative is the
authority for this. Cf. Gay’s <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i> i. 79.</p>

The popular confidence in this view is doubtless
helped by Montgomery, who has made it a
point in his poem on Greenland, canto v. De
Courcy (<i>Hist. of the Church in America</i>, p. 12)
is cited by Howley (<i>Newfoundland</i>) as asserting
that the eastern colony was destroyed by
“a physical cataclysm, which accumulated the
ice.” On the question of a change of climate in
Greenland, see J. D. Whitney’s <i>Climatic Changes</i>
(<i>Mus. Comp. Zoöl. Mem.</i>, 1882, vii. 238).</p>

Rink (<i>Danish Greenland</i>, 22) is not inclined
to believe that there has been any material climatic
change in Greenland since the Norse days,
and favors the supposition that some portion of
the finally remaining Norse became amalgamated
with the Eskimo and disappeared. If the reader
wants circumstantial details of the misfortunes
of their “last man,” he can see how they can be
made out of what are held to be Eskimo traditions
in a chapter of Dr. Hayes’s <i>Land of Desolation</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Nordenskjöld (<i>Voyage of the Vega</i>) holds, such
is the rapid assimilation of a foreign stock by a
native stock, that it is not unlikely that what
descendants may exist of the lost colonists of
Greenland may be now indistinguishable from
the Eskimo.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Tylor (<i>Early Hist. Mankind</i>, p. 208), speaking
of the Eskimo, says: “It is indeed very strange
that there should be no traces found among them
of knowledge of metal-work and of other arts,
which one would expect a race so receptive of
foreign knowledge would have got from contact
with the Northmen.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Prof. Edward S. Morse, in his very curious
study of <i>Ancient and Modern Methods of Arrow
Release</i> (Salem, 1885,&mdash;<i>Bull. Essex Inst.</i>, xvii.)
p. 52, notes that the Eskimo are the only North
American tribe practising what he calls the
“Mediterranean release,” common to all civilized
Europe, and he ventures to accept a surmise
that it may have been derived from the
Scandinavians.</p>

Given by Schlegel, Egede (citing Pontanus),
and Rafn; and a French version is in the <i>Bull.

to be preserved in a copy in the Vatican. M.
F. Howley, <i>Ecclesiastical Hist. of Newfoundland</i>
(Boston, 1888), p. 43, however, says “Abbé
Garnier mentions a bull of Pope Nicholas V, of
date about 1447, concerning the church of Greenland;
but on searching the Bullarium in the
Propaganda library, Rome, in 1885, I could not
find it.”</p>

E. B. Tylor on “Old Scandinavian Civilization
among the modern Esquimaux,” in the
<i>Journal of the Anthropological Inst.</i> (1884), xiii.
348, shows that the Greenlanders still preserve
some of the Norse customs, arising in part, as
he thinks, from some of the lost Scandinavian
survivors being merged in the savage tribes.
Their recollection of the Northmen seems evident
from the traditions collected among them
by Dr. Rink in his <i>Eskimoiske Eventyr og Sagn</i>
(Copenhagen, 1866); and their dress, and some
of their utensils and games, as it existed in the
days of Egede and Crantz, seem to indicate the
survival of customs.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Guignes (<i>Mém. Acad. des Inscriptions</i>, 1761,

and in <i>Notices et Extraits des MSS. de la
bibliothèque du Roi</i>, ii. 24, he describes a MS.
which makes him believe the Arabs reached
America; and he is followed by Munoz (<i>Hist.

(<i>Discoveries and Travels in No. Amer.</i>, Lond.,
1829, i. p. II) and W. D. Cooley (<i>Maritime
Discovery</i>, 1830, i. 172) limit the explorations
respectively to the Azores and the Canaries.
Humboldt (<i>Examen Crit.</i>, 1837, ii. 137) thinks
they may possibly have reached the Canaries;
but Malte Brun (<i>Géog. Universelle</i>, 1841, i. 186)
is more positive. Major (<i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>,
1847) discredits the American theory,
and in his <i>Prince Henry</i> agrees with D’Avezac
that they reached Madeira. Lelewel (<i>Géog. du
Moyen Age</i>, ii. 78) seems likewise incredulous.
S. F. Haven (<i>Archæol. U. S.</i>) gives the theory
and enumerates some of its supporters. Peschel
(<i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>,
1858) is very sceptical. Gaffarel (<i>Etudes</i>, etc.,
p. 209) fails to find proof of the American
theory. Gay (<i>Pop. History U. S.</i>, i. 64) limits
their voyage to the Azores.</p>

De Costa, <i>Verrazano the Explorer</i> (N. Y.,

writing his <i>Isole del Monde</i> in 1521, and
printing it in 1528, had access to the Zeno map
thirty years and more earlier than its publication.
This, he thinks, is evident from the way
in which he made and filled in his outline, and
from his drawing of “Islanda,” even to a like way
of engraving the name, which is in a style of
letter used by Bordone nowhere else. Humboldt
(<i>Cosmos</i>, Bohn’s ed., ii. 611) has also remarked
it as singular that the name Frislanda,
which, as he supposed, was not known on the
maps before the Zeni publication in 1538, should
have been applied by Columbus to an island
southerly from Iceland, in his <i>Tratado de las
cinco zonas habitables</i>. Cf. De Costa’s <i>Columbus
and the Geographers of the North</i> (1872), p. 19.
Of course, Columbus might have used the name
simply descriptively,&mdash;cold land; but it is now
known that in a sea chart of perhaps the fifteenth
century, preserved in the Ambrosian library at
Milan, the name “Fixlanda” is applied to an
island in the position of Frislanda in the Zeno
chart, while in a Catalan chart of the end of the
fifteenth century the same island is apparently
called “Frixlanda” (<i>Studi biog. e bibliog. della
soc. geog. ital.</i>, ii. nos. 400, 404). “Frixanda”
is also on a chart, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1471-83, given in fac-simile
to accompany Wuttke’s “Geschichte der
Erdkunde” in the <i>Jahrbuch des Vereins für
Erdkunde</i> (Dresden, 1870, tab. vi.).</p>

Brevoort (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xiii. 45) thinks that
the “Isola Verde” and “Isle de Mai” of the
fifteenth-century maps, lying in lat. 46° north,
was Newfoundland with its adjacent bank, which
he finds in one case represented. Samuel Robertson
(<i>Lit. &amp; Hist. Soc. Quebec, Trans.</i> Jan. 16)
goes so far as to say that certain relics found in
Canada may be Basque, and that it was a Basque
whaler, named Labrador, who gave the name
to the coast, which the early Portuguese found
attached to it! We find occasional stories indicating
knowledge of distant fishing coasts at a
very early date, like the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“In the yeere 1153 it is written that there came
to Lubec, a citie of Germanie, one canoa with
certaine indians, like unto a long barge, which
seemed to have come from the coast of Baccalaos,
which standeth in the same latitude that
Germanie doth” (<i>Galvano</i>, Bethune’s edition,
p. 56).</p>

W. D. Whitney, <i>Life and Growth of Language</i>,
p. 258, says: “No other dialect of the old
world so much resembles in structure the American
languages.” Cf. Farrar’s <i>Families of Speech</i>,
p. 132; Nott and Gliddon’s <i>Indigenous Races</i>,
48; H. de Charencey’s <i>Des affinités de la langue
Basque avec les idiomes du Nouveau Monde</i>
(Paris and Caen, 1867); and Julien Vinson’s “La
langue basque et les langues Américaines” in
the <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i>
(Nancy, 1875), ii. 46. On the other hand, Joly
(<i>Man before Metals</i>, 316) says: “Whatever may
be said to the contrary, Basque offers no analogy
with the American dialects.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">These linguistic peculiarities enter into all the
studies of this remarkable stock. Cf. J. F.
Blade’s <i>Etude sur l’origine des Basques</i> (Paris,
1869); W. B. Dawkins in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
Sept., 1874, and his <i>Cave Hunting</i>, ch. 6,
with Brabrook’s critique in the <i>Journal Anthropological
Institute</i>, v. 5; and Julien Vinson on
“L’Ethnographie des Basques” in <i>Mém. de la
Soc. d’Ethnographie, Session de 1872</i>, p. 49, with

But see Vol. III. 45; IV. 3. Forster (<i>Northern
Voyages</i>, book iii. ch. 3 and 4) contends for
these pre-Columbian visits of the European fishermen.
Cf. Winsor’s <i>Bibliog. of Ptolemy</i>, sub
anno 1508. The same currents and easterly
trade-winds which helped Columbus might easily
have carried chance vessels to the American
coasts, as we have evidence, apparently, in the
stern-post of a European vessel which Columbus
saw at Guadaloupe. Haven cites Gumilla
(<i>Hist. Orinoco</i>, ii. 208) as stating that in 1731 a
bateau from Teneriffe was thrown upon the
South American coast. Cf. J. P. Casselius, <i>De
Navigationibus fortuitis in Americam, ante Columbum
factis</i> (Magdeburg, 1742); Brasseur’s <i>Popul
Vuh</i>, introd.; Hunt’s <i>Merchants’ Mag.</i> xxv. 275.</p>

Francisque-Michel, <i>Le Pays Basque</i>, 189,
who says that the Basques were acquainted with
the coasts of Newfoundland a century before
Columbus (ch. 9).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Humboldt (<i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. ed. ii. 142) is not
prepared to deny such early visits of the Basques
to the northern fishing grounds. Cf. Gaffarel’s
<i>Rapport</i>, p. 212. Harrisse (<i>Notes on Columbus</i>,
80) goes back very far: “The Basques and
Northmen, we feel confident, visited these shores
as early as the seventh century.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are some recent studies on these early
fishing experiences in Ferd. Duro’s <i>Disquisiciones
nauticas</i> (1881), and in E. Gelcich’s “Der
Fischgang des Gascogner and die Entdeckung

<p class="pfc4">Galvano (Hakluyt Soc. ed., p. 72) recounts
the story of a Portuguese ship in 1447 being
driven westward from the Straits of Gibraltar to
an island with seven cities, where they found the
people speaking Portuguese; who said they had
deserted their country on the death of King
Roderigo. “All these reasons seem to agree,”
adds Galvano, “that this should be that country
which is called Nova Spagna.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">It was the year (1491) before Columbus’ voyage
that the English began to send out from Bristol
expeditions to discover these islands of the seven
cities, and others having the same legendary existence.

Stephens (<i>Central America</i>) holds similar views. Cf. Wilson, <i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. 327; ii. 43. Dall (<i>Third

however, that immigration ceased with these original people.”</p>

Different shades of belief are abundant: F. Xavier de Orrio’s <i>Solucion del gran problema</i> (Mexico,
1763); Fischer’s <i>Conjecture sur l’origine des Américaines</i>; Adair’s <i>Amer. Indians;</i> G. A. Thompson’s <i>New

397; a paper on Asiatic tribes in North America, in <i>Canadian Institute Proceedings</i> (1881), i. 171. Dabry
de Thiersant, in his <i>Origine des Indiens du nouv. monde</i> (Paris, 1883), reopens the question, and Quatrefages
even brings the story of Moncacht-Ape (see <i>post</i>, Vol. V. p. 77) to support a theory of frequent Asiatic
communication. Tylor (<i>Early Hist. Mankind</i>, 209) says that the Asiatics must have taught the Mexicans
to make bronze and smelt iron; and (p. 339) he finds additional testimony in the correspondence of myths,
but Max Müller (<i>Chips</i>, ii. 168) demurs. Nadaillac, in his <i>L’Amérique préhistorique</i>, discussed this with the
other supposable connections of the American people, and generally disbelieved in them; but Dall, in the English
translation, summarily dismisses all consideration of them as unworthy a scientific mind; but points out
what the early Indian traditions are (p. 526).</p>
<p class="pfc4">A good deal of stress has been laid at times on certain linguistic affiliations. Barton, in his <i>New Views</i>,
sought to strengthen the case by various comparative vocabularies. Charles Farcy went over the proofs in his
<i>Antiquités de l’Amérique: Discuter la valeur des documents relatifs à l’histoire de l’Amérique avant la
conquête des Européens, et déterminer s’il existe des rapports entre les langues de l’Amérique et celles
des tribus de l’Afrique et de l’Asie</i> (Paris, 1836). H. H. Bancroft (<i>Native Races</i>, v. 39) enumerates the
sources of the controversy. Roehrig (<i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1872) finds affinities in the languages of the
Dakota or Sioux Indians. Pilling (<i>Bibliog. of Siouan languages</i>, p. 11) gives John Campbell’s contributions
to this comparative study. In the <i>Canadian Institute Proceedings</i> (1881), vol. i. p. 171, Campbell
points out the affinities of the Tinneh with the Tungus, and of the Choctaws and Cherokees with the Koriaks.
Cf. also <i>Ibid</i>., July, 1884. Dall and Pinart pronounce against any affinity of tongues in the <i>Contributions
to Amer. Ethnology</i> (Washington), i. 97. Cf. Short, <i>No. Amer. of Antiq.</i>, 494; Leland’s <i>Fusang</i>,

Behring’s Straits, first opened, as Wallace says, in quaternary times, are 45 miles across, and are often frozen
in winter. South of them is an island where a tribe of Eskimos live, and they keep constant communication
with the main of Asia, 50 miles distant, and with America, 120 miles away. Robertson solved the difficulty
by this route. Cf. <i>Contributions to Amer. Ethnology</i> (1877), i. 95-98; Warden’s <i>Recherches</i>; Maury,

only.</p>

Gomara makes record of such floating visitors in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Horace Davis
published in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i> (Apr., 1872) a record of Japanese vessels driven upon the northwest
coast of America and its outlying islands in a paper “On the likelihood of an admixture of Japanese blood on
our northwest coast.” Cf. A. W. Bradford’s <i>American Antiquities</i> (N. Y., 1841); Whymper’s <i>Alaska</i>, 250;

carries floating objects to the American coast. Davis, in his tract, gives a map of it. Cf. Haven, <i>Archæol.

Much depends on the distance intended by a Chinese <i>li</i>. Klaproth translated the version as given by an
early Chinese historian of the seventh century, Li Yan Tcheou, and Klaproth’s version is Englished in Bancroft’s
<i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 33-36. Klaproth’s memoir is also translated in Vining, ch. 3. Some have more specifically
pointed to Saghalien, an island at the north end of the Japan Sea. Brooks says there is a district of
Corea called Fusang (<i>Science</i>, viii. 402). Brasseur says the great Chinese encyclopædia describes Fusang as
lying east of Japan, and he thinks the descriptions correspond to the Cibola of Castañeda.</p>

The pamphlets are translated in Vining, ch. 4 and 5. Paravey held to the Mexican theory, and he at
least convinced Domenech (<i>Seven years’ residence in the great deserts of No. Amer.</i>, Lond., 1860). Paravey
published several pamphlets on subjects allied to this. His <i>Mémoire sur l’origine japonaise, arabe et basque
de la civilisation des peuples du plateau de Bogota d’après les travaux de Humboldt et Siebold</i> (Paris, 1835)
is a treatise on the origin of the Muyscas or Chibchas. Jomard, in his <i>Les Antiquités Américaines au point
de vue des progrès de la géographie</i> (Paris, 1817) in the <i>Bull. de la Soc. Géog.</i>, had questioned the Asiatic
affiliations, and Paravey replied in a <i>Réfutation de l’opinion émise par Jomard que les peuples de l’Amérique
n’ont jamais en aucun rapport avec ceux de l’Asie</i> (Paris, 1849), originally in the <i>Annales de philosophie
Chrétienne</i> (May, 1849).</p>

S. W. Williams, in the <i>Journal of the American Oriental Soc.</i> (vol. xi.), in controverting the views of
Leland, was inclined to find Fusang in the Loo-choo Islands. This paper was printed separately as <i>Notices

A good deal of labor has been bestowed to prove this identity of Fusang with Mexico. It is held to be
found in the myths and legends of the two people by Charency in his <i>Mythe de Votan, étude sur les origines
asiatiques de la civilisation américaine</i> (Alençon, 1871), drawn from the <i>Actes de la Soc. philologique</i> (vol.
ii.); and he has enforced similar views in the <i>Revue des questions historiques</i> (vi. 283), and in his <i>Djemschid
et Quetzalcohuatl. L’histoire légendaire de la Nouvelle-Espagne rapprochée de la source indo-européenne</i>
(Alençon, 1874). Humboldt thought it strange, considering other affinities,&mdash;as for instance in the Mexican
calendars,&mdash;that he could find no Mexican use of phallic symbols; but Bancroft says they exist. Cf. <i>Native
Races</i>, iii. 501; also see v. 40, 232; Brasseur’s <i>Quatre Lettres</i>, p. 202; and John Campbell’s paper on the
traditions of Mexico and Peru as establishing such connections, in the <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des Amér.</i>
(Nancy, 1875), i. 348. Dr. Hamy saw in a monument found at Copan an inscription which he thought was
the Taë-kai of the Chinese, the symbol of the essence of all things (<i>Bull. de la Soc. de Géog.</i>, 1886, and
<i>Journal of the Anthropological Institute</i>, xvi. 242, with a cut of the stone). Dall controverts this point
(<i>Science</i>, viii. 402).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Others have dwelt on the linguistic resemblances. B. S. Barton in his <i>New Views</i> pressed this side of the
question. The presence of a monosyllabic tongue like the Otomi in the midst of the polysyllabic languages
of Mexico has been thought strongly to indicate a survival. Cf. Manuel Najera’s <i>Disertacion sobre la lengua
Othomi</i>, Mexico, 1845, and in <i>Amer. Philos. Soc. Trans.</i>, n. s., v.; Ampère’s <i>Promenade en Amérique</i>, ii.
301; Prescott’s <i>Mexico</i>, iii. 396; Warden’s <i>Recherches</i> (in Dupaix), p. 125; Latham’s <i>Races of Men</i>, 408;
Bancroft’s <i>Nat. Races</i>, iii. 737; v. 39, with references. Others find Sanskrit roots in the Mexican. E. B.
Tylor has indicated the Asiatic origin of certain Mexican games (<i>Journal of the Anthropol. Inst.</i>, xxiv.).
Ornaments of jade found in Nicaragua, while the stone is thought to be native only in Asia, is another indication,
and they are more distinctively Asiatic than the jade ornaments found in Alaska (<i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>,
xviii. 414; xx. 548; <i>Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc.</i>, Jan., 1886).</p>
<p class="pfc4">On the general question of the Asiatic origin of the Mexicans see Dupaix’s <i>Antiquités Méxicaines</i>, with
included papers by Lenoir, Warden, and Farcy; the <i>Report</i> on a railroad route from the Mississippi, 1853-54
(Washington); Whipple’s and other <i>Reports</i> on the Indian tribes; John Russell Bartlett’s <i>Personal Narrative</i>
(1854); Brasseur’s <i>Popul Vuh</i>, p. xxxix; Viollet le Duc’s belief in a “yellow race” building the
Mexican and Central American monuments, in Charnay’s <i>Ruines Américaines</i>, and Charnay’s traces of the
Buddhists in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i>, July, 1879, p. 432; Le Plongeon’s belief in the connection of the
Maya and Asiatic races in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Apr. 30, 1879, p. 113; and some papers on the ancient
Mexicans and their origin by the Abbé Jolibois, Col. Parmentier, and M. Emile Guimet, which, prepared for
the Soc. de Géog. de Lyon, were published separately as <i>De l’origine des Anciens Peuples du Méxique</i>
(Lyon, 1875).</p>
<p class="pfc4">A few other incidental discussions of the Fusang question are these: R. H. Major in <i>Select Letters of
Columbus</i> (1847); J. T. Short in <i>The Galaxy</i> (1875) and in his <i>No. Americans of Antiquity</i>; Nadaillac in
his <i>L’Amérique préhistorique</i>, 544; Gay’s <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i> calls the story vague and improbable. In periodicals
we find: <i>Gentleman’s Mag.</i>, 1869, p. 333 (reprinted in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Sept., 1869, xvi. 221), and 1870, reproduced
in <i>Chinese Recorder</i>, May, 1870; Nathan Brown in <i>Amer. Philolog. Mag.</i>, Aug., 1869; Wm. Speer in
<i>Princeton Rev.</i>, xxv. 83; <i>Penn Monthly</i>, vi. 603; <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Apr., 1883, p. 291; <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
iii. 58, 78; iv. 19; <i>Notes and Queries in China and Japan</i>, Apr., May, 1869; Feb., 1870. Chas. W. Brooks
maintained on the other hand (<i>Proc. California Acad. Sciences</i>, 1876; cf. Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i>, v. 51),
that the Chinese were emigrants from America. There is a map of the supposed Chinese route to America in
the <i>Congrès des Américanistes</i> (Nancy, 1875), vol. i.; and Winchell, <i>Pre-Adamites</i>, gives a chart showing
different lines of approach from Asia. Stephen Powers (<i>Overland Monthly</i>, Apr., 1872, and <i>California
Acad. Sciences</i>, 1875) treats the California Indians as descendants of the Chinese,&mdash;a view he modifies in the
<i>Contrib. to Amer. Ethnology</i>, vol. iii., on “Tribes of California.” It is claimed that Chinese coin of the
fifteenth century have been found in mounds on Vancouver’s Island. Cf. G. P. Thurston in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>,
xiii. p. 457. The principal lists of authorities are those in Vining (app.), and Watson’s in Anderson’s <i>America
not discovered by Columbus</i>.</p>

From Easter Island to the Galapagos is 2,000 miles, thence to South America 600 more. On such long
migrations by water see Waitz, <i>Introduction to Anthropology</i>, Eng. transl., p. 202. On early modes of
navigation see Col. A. Lane Fox in the <i>Journal Anthropological Inst.</i> (1875), iv. 399. Otto Caspari gives a
map of post-tertiary times in his <i>Urgeschichte der Menschheit</i> (Leipzig, 1873), vol. i., in which land is made
to stretch from the Marquesas Islands nearly to South America; while large patches of land lie between Asia
and Mexico, to render migration practicable. Andrew Murray, in his <i>Geographical Distribution of Mammals</i>
(London, 1866), is almost compelled to admit (p. 25) that as complete a circuit of land formerly crossed the
southern temperate regions as now does the northern; and Daniel Wilson, <i>Prehistoric Man</i>, holds much the
same opinion. The connection of the flora of Polynesia and South America is discussed by J. D. Hooker in
the <i>Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of the Erebus and Terror, 1839-43</i>, and in his <i>Flora of Tasmania</i>.

Bancroft, <i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 44, with references, p. 48, epitomizes the story. Cf. Short, 151. There was a

A belief in the Asiatic connection has taken some curious forms. Montesinos in his <i>Memorias Peruanas</i>
held Peru to be the Ophir of Solomon. Cf. Gotfriedus Wegner’s <i>De Navigationis Solomonæis</i> (Frankfort,
1689). Horn held Hayti to be Ophir, and he indulges in some fantastic evidences to show that the Iroquois,
<i>i. e.</i> Yrcas, were Turks! Cf. Onffroy de Thoron in <i>Le Globe</i>, 1869. C. Wiener in his <i>L’Empire des Incas</i>
(ch. 2, 4) finds traces of Buddhism, and so does Hyde Clarke in his <i>Khita-Peruvian Epoch</i> (1877). Lopez
has written on <i>Les Races Aryennes de Pérou</i> (1871). Cf. Robert Ellis, <i>Peruvia Scythica</i>. <i>The Quicha
Language of Peru, its derivation from Central Asia with the American languages in general</i> (London,
1875). Grotius held that the Peruvians were of Chinese stock. Charles Pickering’s ethnological map gives a
Malay origin to the islands of the Gulf of Mexico and a part of the Pacific coast, the rest being Mongolian.</p>

<i>A Memoir on the European Colonization of America in antehistoric times</i> was contributed to the <i>Proceedings</i>
of the American Ethnological Society in 1851, to which E. G. Squier added some notes, the original
paper being by Dr. C. A. A. Zestermann of Leipzig. The aim was to prove, by the similarity of remains, the
connection of the peoples who built the mounds of the Ohio Valley with the early peoples of northwestern
Europe, a Caucasian race, which he would identify with the settlers of Irland it Mikla, and with the coming
of the white-bearded men spoken of in Mexican traditions, who established a civilization which an inundating
population from Asia subsequently buried from sight. This European immigration he places at least 1,200
years before Christ. Squier’s comments are that the monumental resemblances referred to indicate similar
conditions of life rather than ethnic connections.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The other advocate was Eugène Beauvois in a paper published in the <i>Compte Rendu du Congrès des
Américanistes</i> (Nancy, 1875, p. 4) as <i>La découverte du nouveau monde par les irlandais et les premières
traces du christianisme en Amérique avant l’an 1000</i>, accompanied by a map, in which he makes Irland it
Mikla correspond to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Again, in the session at Luxembourg in 1877, he
endeavored to connect the Irish colony with the narrative of the seaman in the Zeno accounts, in a paper which
he called <i>Les Colonies Européennes du Markland et de l’Escociland au xiv. Siècle, et les vestiges qui en
subsistèrent jusqu’aux xvi<sup>e</sup> et xvii<sup>e</sup> Siècles</i>, and in which he identifies the Estotiland of the Frislanda
mariner. M. Beauvois again, at the Copenhagen meeting of the same body, read a paper on <i>Les Relations
précolumbiennes des Gaels avec le Méxique</i> (Copenhagen, 1883, p. 74), in which he elicited objections from
M. Lucien Adam. Beauvois belongs to that class of enthusiasts somewhat numerous in these studies of pre-Columbian
discoveries, who have haunted these Congresses of Americanists, and who see overmuch. Other
references to these Irish claims are to be found in Laing’s <i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 186; Beamish’s <i>Discovery of
America</i> (London, 1841); Gravier’s <i>Découverte de l’Amérique</i>, p. 123, 137, and his <i>Les Normands sur la

There are various editions, of which the best is called that of Copenhagen, 1843. The <i>Islendingabók</i>, a
sort of epitome of a lost historical narrative, is considered an introduction to the <i>Landnámabók</i>. Much of
the early story will be found in Latin in the <i>Islenzkir Annáler, sive Annales Islandici ab anno Christi 803
ad anno 1430</i> (Copenhagen, 1847); in the <i>Scripta historica Islandorum de rebus veterum Borealium</i>, published
by the Royal Soc. of Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen, 1828-46; and in Jacobus Langebek’s <i>Scriptores
Rerum Danicarum medii ævi</i> (Copenhagen, 1772-1878,&mdash;the ninth volume being a recently added

A convenient survey of this early literature is in chapter 1 of the <i>History of the Literature of the Scandinavian

Baring-Gould in his <i>Iceland, its Scenes and Sagas</i> (London, 1863) gives in his App. D a list of thirty-five
published sagas, sixty-six local histories, twelve ecclesiastical annals, and sixty-nine Norse annals. Cf.
the eclectic list in Laing’s <i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 17.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Konrad Maurer has given an elaborate essay on this early literature in his <i>Ueber die Ausdrücke: altnordische,
altnorwegische und isländische Sprache</i> (Munich, 1867), which originally appeared in the <i>Abhandlungen</i>
of the Bavarian Academy.</p>
<p class="pfc4">G. P. Marsh translated P. E. Müller’s “Origin, progress, and decline of Icelandic historical literature” in
<i>The American Eclectic</i> (N. Y., 1841,&mdash;vols. i., ii.). In 1781, Lindblom printed at Paris a French translation
of Bishop Troil’s <i>Lettres sur l’Islande</i>, which contained a catalogue of books on Iceland and an enumeration
of the Icelandic sagas. (Cf. Pinkerton’s <i>Voyages</i>, vol. i.) Chavanne’s <i>Bibliography of the Polar Regions</i>,
p. 95, has a section on Iceland.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Solberg’s list of illustrative works, appended to Anderson’s version of Horn’s <i>Lit. of the Scandinavian
North</i>, is useful so far as the English language goes. Periodical contributions also appear in <i>Poole’s Index</i>

Maurer had long been a student of Icelandic lore, and his <i>Isländische Volkssagen der Gegenwart gesammelt
und verdeutscht</i> (Leipzig, 1860) is greatly illustrative of the early north. Conybeare (<i>Place of Iceland
in the History of European Institutions</i>, preface) says: “To any one writing on Iceland the elaborate works
of the learned Maurer afford at once a help and difficulty: a help in so far as they shed the fullest light
upon the subjects; a difficulty in that their painstaking completeness has brought together well-nigh everything
that can be said.”</p>

<p class="pfc4">A summarized statement of life in Iceland in the early days is held to be well made out in Hans O. H.
Hildebrand’s <i>Lifvet þå Island under Sagotiden</i> (Stockholm, 1867), and in A. E. Holmberg’s <i>Nordbon under
Hednatiden</i> (Stockholm). J. A. Worsaae published his <i>Vorgeschichte des Nordens</i> at Hamburg in 1878.
It was improved in a Danish edition in 1880, and from this H. F. Morland Simpson made the <i>Prehistory of
the North, based on contemporary materials</i> (London, 1886), with a memoir of Worsaae (d. 1885), the foremost
scholar in this northern lore.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Some of the earliest references are: Christopherson Claus’ <i>Den Grölandske Chronica</i> (Copenhagen, 1608),
noticed in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, ii., no. 64. Gerald de Veer’s <i>True and perfect description of three
voyages</i> speaks in its title (<i>Carter-Brown</i>, ii. 38) of “the countrie lying under 80 degrees, which is thought to
be Greenland, where never man had been before.” Antoine de la Sale wrote between 1438 and 1447 a curious
book, printed in 1527 as <i>La Salade</i>, in which he refers to Iceland and Greenland (Gronnellont), where white
bears abound (Harrisse, <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, no. 140).</p>

This book is now rare. Dufossé prices it at 50 francs; F. S. Ellis,&mdash;London. 1884, at £5.5.0. Before
Torfæus, probably the best known book was Isaac de la Peyrère’s <i>Relation du Groenland</i> (Paris, 1647). It
is one of the earliest books to give an account of the Eskimos. It was again printed in 1674 in <i>Recueil de
Voyages du Nord</i>. A Dutch edition at Amsterdam in 1678 (<i>Nauwkenrige Beschrijvingh van Groenland</i>)
was considerably enlarged with other matter, and this edition was the basis of the German version published
at Nuremberg, 1679. Peyrère’s description will be found in English in a volume published by the Hakluyt
Society in 1855, where it is accompanied by two maps of the early part of the seventeenth century. Cf. Carter-Brown,
ii., no. 1192, note; Sabin, x. p. 70.</p>

Pilling (<i>Eskimo Bibliog.</i>, p. 20) gives the most careful account of editions. Cf. Sabin, v. 66. A Dutch
translation at Haarlem in 1767 was provided with better and larger maps than the original issue; and this
version was again brought out with a changed title in 1786. There was a Swedish ed. at Stockholm in 1769,
and a reprint of the original German at Leipzig in 1770, and it is included in the <i>Bibliothek der neuesten
Reisebeschreibungen</i> (Frankfort, 1779-1797), vol. xx. Cf. Carter-Brown, ii., nos. 1443, 1576, 1577, 1671, 1728.</p>

This tendency of the Scandinavian writers is recognized among themselves. Horn (Anderson’s translation,
324) ascribes it to “an unbridled fancy and want of critical method rather than to any wilful perversion
of historical truth. This tendency owed its origin to an intense patriotism, a leading trait in the Swedish
character, which on this very account was well-nigh incorrigible.”</p>

Dasent translates from the preface to <i>Egils Saga</i> (Reikjavik, 1856): “The sagas show no wilful purpose
to tell untruths, but simply are proofs of <i>the beliefs and turns of thought of men in the age when the sagas
were reduced to writing</i>” (<i>Burnt Njal</i>, i. p. xiii).</p>

Rink (<i>Danish Greenland</i>, p. 3) says of the sagas that “they exist only in a fragmentary condition, and
bear the general character of popular traditions to such a degree that they stand much in need of being corroborated
by collateral proofs, if we are wholly to rely upon them in such a question as an ancient colonization
of America.” So he proceeds to enumerate the kind of evidence, which is sufficient in Greenland, but is
wholly wanting in other parts of America, and to point out that the trustworthiness of the sagas of the Vinland
voyages exists only in regard to their general scope.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Dasent, in the introduction of Vigfússon’s <i>Icelandic Dictionary</i>, says of the sagas: “Written at various
periods by scribes more or less fitted for the task, they are evidently of very varying authority.” The Scandinavian
authorities class the sagas as mythical histories, as those relating to Icelandic history (subdivided into
general, family, personal, ecclesiastical), and as the lives of rulers.</p>

Laing (<i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 23) says: “Arne Magnussen was the greatest antiquary who never wrote; his
judgments and opinions are known from notes, selections, and correspondence, and are of great authority at
this day in the saga literature. Torfæus consulted him in his researches.”</p>

Discovered in the seventeenth century in a monastery on an island close by the Icelandic coast, and now
in the royal library in Copenhagen. Cf. Laing’s introduction to his edition of the <i>Heimskringla</i>, vol. i.
p. 157. Horn says of this codex: “The book was written towards the end of the fourteenth century by two
Icelandic priests, and contains in strange confusion and wholly without criticism a large number of sagas,
poems, and stories. No other manuscript confuses things on so vast a scale.” Anderson’s translation of

When, however, Peringskiöld edited the Heimskringla, in 1697, he interpolated eight chapters of a more
particular account of the Vinland voyages, which drew forth some animadversions from Torfæus in 1705, when
he published his <i>Historia Vinlandiæ</i>. It was later found that Peringskiöld had drawn these eight chapters
from the <i>Codex Flatoyensis</i>, which particular MS. was unknown to Torfæus. When Laing printed his edition
of the <i>Heimskringla, The Sea Kings of Norway</i> (London, 1844), he translated these eight chapters in his
appendix (vol. iii. 344). Laing (<i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 27) says: “Snorro Sturleson has done for the history of
the Northmen what Livy did for the history of the Romans,”&mdash;a rather questionable tribute to the verity of
the saga history, in the light of the most approved comments on Livy. Cf. Horn, in Anderson’s translation,
<i>Lit. of the Scandinavian North</i> (Chicago, 1884), p. 56, with references, p. 59.</p>

J. Fulford Vicary’s <i>Saga Time</i> (Lond., 1887). Some time in the fifteenth century, a monk, Thomas
Gheysmer, made an abridgment of Saxo, alleging that he “had said much rather for the sake of adornment
than in behalf of truth.” The Canon Christiern Pederson printed the first edition of Saxo at Paris in 1514
(Anderson’s Horn’s <i>Lit. Scandin. North</i>, p. 102). This writer adds: “The entire work rests exclusively on
oral tradition, which had been gathered by Saxo, and which he repeated precisely as he had heard it, for in the
whole chronicle there is no trace of criticism proper.... Saxo must also undoubtedly have had Icelandic
sagamen as authorities for the legendary part of his work; but there is not the slightest evidence to show that
he ever had a written Icelandic saga before him.... In this part of the work he betrays no effort to separate
fact from fiction, ... and he has in many instances consciously or unconsciously adorned the original material.”
Horn adds that the last and best edition is that of P. E. Müller and J. Velchow, <i>Saxonis Grammatici
Historia Danica</i> (Copenhagen, 1839).</p>

Humboldt (<i>Crit. Exam.</i>, ii. 120) represented that Ortelius referred to these voyages in 1570; but Palfrey

Professor Willard Fiske has paid particular attention to the early forms of the Danish in the Icelandic
literature. In 1885 the British Museum issued a <i>Catalogue of the books printed in Iceland from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1578
to 1880 in the library of the British Museum</i>. In 1886 Mr. Fiske privately printed at Florence <i>Bibliographical
Notices, i.: Books printed in Iceland, 1578-1844, a supplement to the British Museum Catalogue,</i>
which enumerates 139 titles with full bibliographical detail and an index. He refers also to the principal
bibliographical authorities. Laing’s introduction to the <i>Heimskringla</i> gives a survey.</p>

to the American archæologist being the <i>Antiquarisk Tidsskrift</i> (1845-1864), sometimes known as the <i>Revue
Archéologique et Bulletin</i>, the society, under its more familiar name of Société Royale des Antiquaires du
Nord, has issued its <i>Mémoires</i>, the first series running from 1836 to 1860, in 4 vols., and the second beginning
in 1866. These contain numerous papers involving the discussion of the Northmen voyages, including a condensed
narrative by Rafn, “Mémoire sur la découverte de l’Amérique au 10<sup>e</sup> siècle,” which was enlarged and
frequently issued separately in French and other languages (1838-1843), and is sometimes found in English as
a <i>Supplement to the Antiquitates Americanæ</i>, and was issued in New York (1838) as <i>America discovered in
the tenth century</i>. In this form (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, viii. 187) it was widely used here and in Europe to
call attention to Rafn’s folio, <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The <i>Mémoires</i> also contained another paper by Rafn, <i>Aperçu de l’ancienne géographie des régions

also concerns the Vinland voyages, and is repeated in the <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i> (1849), i. 277.</p>

Scandinaves</i> (Copenhagen, 1845). An abstract of the evidence is given in the <i>Journal of the Royal Geographical
Society</i> (viii. 114), and it is upon this that H. H. Bancroft depends in his <i>Native Races</i> (v. 106).

<p class="pfc4">Great efforts were made by Rafn and his friends to get reviews of his folio in American periodicals; and he
relied in this matter upon Dr. Webb and others, with whom he had been in correspondence in working up his
geographical details (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ii. 97, 107; viii. 189, etc.), and so late as 1852 he drafted in
English a new synopsis of the evidence, and sent it over for distribution in the United States (<i>Ibid.</i> ii. 500;
<i>New Jersey Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, vi.; <i>N. E. Hist. Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1853, p. 13). So far as weight of character went,
there was a plenty of it in his reviewers: Edward Everett in the <i>No. Amer. Rev.</i>, Jan., 1838; Alexander
Everett in the <i>U. S. Magazine and Democratic Review</i> (1838); George Folsom in the <i>N. Y. Review</i> (1838);

Bohn’s ed., English transl., ii. 603; Lond. ed., 1849, ii. 233-36. Humboldt expresses the opinion that
Columbus, during his visit to Iceland, got no knowledge of the stories, so little an impression had they made on
the public mind (<i>Cosmos</i>, Bohn, ii. 611), and that the enemies of Columbus in his famous lawsuit, when every
effort was made to discredit his enterprise, did not instance his Iceland experience, should be held to indicate
that no one in southern Europe believed in any such prompting at that time. Wheaton and Prescott (<i>Ferdinand
and Isabella</i>, orig. ed., ii. 118, 131) hold similar opinions. (Cf. Vol. II. p. 33.) Dr. Webb says that Irving
held back from accepting the stories of the saga, for fear that they could be used to detract from Columbus’
fame. Rafn and his immediate sympathizers did not fail to make the most of the supposition that Columbus
had in some way profited by his Iceland experience. Laing thinks Columbus must have heard of the voyages,
and De Costa (<i>Columbus and the Geographers of the North</i>) thinks that the bruit of the Northmen
voyages extended sufficiently over Europe to render it unlikely that it escaped the ears of Columbus. Cf.
further an appendix in Irving’s <i>Columbus</i>, and Mallet’s <i>Northern Antiquities</i>, Bohn’s ed., 267, in refutation
of the conclusions of Finn Magnusen in the <i>Nordisk Tidsskrift</i>. It has been left for the unwise and overtopped
advocates of a later day, like Goodrich and Marie A. Brown, to go beyond reason in an indiscriminate
denunciation of the Genoese. The latter writer, in her <i>Icelandic Discoverers of America</i> (Boston, 1888),
rambles over the subject in a jejune way, and easily falls into errors, while she pursues her main purpose
of exposing what she fancies to be a deep-laid scheme of the Pope and the Catholic Church to conceal the
merits of the Northmen and to capture the sympathies of Americans in honoring the memory of Columbus in
1892. It is simply a reactionary craze from the overdone raptures of the school of Roselly de Lorgues and
the other advocates of the canonization of Columbus, in Catholic Europe.</p>

He was rather caustically taken to account by Henry Cabot Lodge, in the <i>No. Am. Review</i>, vol. cxix.
Cf. Michel Hardy’s <i>Les Scandinaves dans l’Amérique du Nord</i> (Dieppe, 1874). An April hoax which
appeared in a Washington paper in 1867, about some runes discovered on the Potomac, had been promptly
exposed in this country (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Mar. and Aug., 1869), but it had been accepted as true in the <i>Annuaire de
la Société Américaine</i> in 1873, and Gaffarel (<i>Etudes sur les Rapports de l’Amérique avant Columbus</i>, Paris,
1869, p. 251) and Gravier (p. 139) was drawn into the snare. (Cf. Whittlesey’s <i>Archæol. frauds</i> in the <i>Western
Reserve Hist. Soc. Tracts</i>, no. 9, and H. W. Haynes in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Jan., 1888, p. 59.) In a
later monograph, <i>Les Normands sur la route des Indes</i> (Rouen, 1880), Gravier, while still accepting the old
exploded geographical theories, undertook further to prove that the bruits of the Norse discoveries instigated
the seamen of Normandy to similar ventures, and that they visited America in ante-Columbian days.</p>

Forster finds a corruption of Norvegia (Norway) in Norumbega. Rafn finds the Norse elements in the
words Massachusetts, Nauset, and Mount Hope (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, viii. 194-198). The word Hole, used
as synonymous to harbor in various localities along the Vineyard Sound, has been called a relic of the Icelandic
Holl, a hill (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, June, 1882, p. 431; Jos. S. Fay in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xii. 334; and in

So plain a matter as the length of the longest summer day would indubitably point to an absolute parallel
of latitude as determining the site of Vinland, if there was no doubt in the language of the saga. Unfortunately
there is a wide divergence of opinion in the meaning of the words to be depended upon, even among
Icelandic scholars; and the later writers among them assert that Rafn (<i>Antiq. Amer.</i> 436) and Magnusen in
interpreting the language to confirm their theory of the Rhode Island bays have misconceived. Their argument
is summarized in the French version of Wheaton. John M’Caul translated Finn Magnusen’s “Ancient
Scandinavian divisions of the times of day,” in the <i>Mémoire de la Soc. Roy. des Antiq. du Nord</i> (1836-37).
Rask disputes Rafn’s deductions (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xviii. 22). Torfæus, who is our best commentator
after all, says it meant Newfoundland. Robertson put it at 58° north. Dahlmann in his <i>Forschungen</i> (vol. i.)
places it on the coast of Labrador. Horsford (p. 66) at some length admits no question that it must have
been between 41° and 43° north. Cf. Laing’s <i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 173; Palfrey’s <i>New England</i>, i. 55; De
Costa’s <i>Pre-Columbian Disc.</i>, p. 33; Weise’s <i>Discoveries of America</i>, 31; and particularly Vigfússon in his
<i>English-Icelandic Dictionary</i> under “Eykt.”</p>

“The discovery of America,” says Laing (<i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 154), “rests entirely upon documentary evidence
which cannot, as in the case of Greenland, be substantiated by anything to be discovered in America.” Laing
and many of the commentators, by some strange process of reasoning, have determined that the proof of these
MS. records being written before Columbus’ visit to Iceland in 1477 is sufficient to establish the priority of
discovery for the Northmen, as if it was nothing in the case that the sagas may or may not be good history;
and nothing that it was the opinion entertained in Europe at that time that Greenland and the more distant
lands were not a new continent, but a prolongation of Europe by the north. It is curious, too, to observe that,
treating of events after 1492, Laing is quite willing to believe in any saga being “filled up and new invented,”
but is quite unwilling to believe anything of the kind as respects those written anterior to 1492; and yet he
goes on to prove conclusively that the <i>Flatoyensis Codex</i> is full of fable, as when the saga man makes the
eider-duck lay eggs where during the same weeks the grapes ripen and intoxicate when fresh, and the wheat
forms in the ear! Laing nevertheless rests his case on the <i>Flatoyensis Codex</i> in its most general scope, and
calls poets, but not antiquaries, those who attempt to make any additional evidence out of imaginary runes or
the identification of places.</p>

It must be remembered that this divergence was not so wide to the Northmen as it seems to us. With
them the Atlantic was sometimes held to be a great basin that was enclasped from northwestern Europe by a
prolongation of Scandinavia into Greenland, Helluland, and Markland, and it was a question if the more
distant region of Vinland did not belong rather to the corresponding prolongation of Africa on the south.

held their intercourse.” The committee of the Mass. Hist. Soc. objected to this extreme confidence. <i>Proceedings</i>,

The stone with its inscription early attracted attention, but Danforth’s drawing of 1680 is the earliest
known. Cotton Mather, in a dedicatory epistle to Sir Henry Ashurst, prefixed to his <i>Wonderful Works of
God commemorated</i> (Boston, 1690), gave a cut of a part of the inscription; and he communicated an account
with a drawing of the inscription to the Royal Society in 1712, which appears in their <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.
Dr. Isaac Greenwood sent another draft to the Society of Antiquaries in London in 1730, and
their <i>Transactions</i> in 1732 has this of Greenwood. In 1768 Professor Stephen Sewall of Cambridge made
a copy of the natural size, which was sent in 1774 by Professor James Winthrop to the Royal Society.
Dr. Stiles says that Sewall sent it to Gebelin, of the French Academy, whose members judged them to
be Punic characters. Stiles himself, in 1783, in an election sermon delivered at Hartford, spoke of “the
visit by the Phœnicians, who charged the Dighton Rock and other rocks in Narragansett Bay with Punic
inscriptions remaining to this day, which last I myself have repeatedly seen and taken off at large.” Cf.
Thornton’s <i>Pulpit of the Revolution</i>, p. 410. The <i>Archæologia</i> (London, viii. for 1786) gave various drawings,
with a paper by the Rev. Michael Lort and some notes by Charles Vallancey, in which the opinion was
expressed that the inscription was the work of a people from Siberia, driven south by hordes of Tartars.
Professor Winthrop in 1788 filled the marks, as he understood them, with printer’s ink, and in this way took
an actual impression of the inscription. His copy was engraved in the <i>Memoirs of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences</i> (vol. ii. for 1793). It was this copy by Winthrop which Washington in 1789 saw at
Cambridge, when he pronounced the inscription as similar to those made by the Indians, which he had been
accustomed to see in the western country during his life as a surveyor. Cf. <i>Belknap Papers, Mass. Hist. Soc.
Coll.</i>, ii. 76, 77, 81; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, x. 114. In 1789 there was also presented to the Academy a copy
made by Joseph Gooding under the direction of Francis Baylies (<i>Belknap Papers</i>, ii. 160). In the third
volume of the Academy’s <i>Memoirs</i> there are papers on the inscription by John Davis and Edward A. Kendall;
Davis (1807) thinking it a representation of an Indian deer hunt, and Kendall later, in his <i>Travels</i> (vol. ii.
1809), assigns it to the Indians. This description is copied in Barber’s <i>Historical Collections of Mass.</i> (p.
117). In 1812 a drawing was made by Job Gardner, and in 1825 there was further discussion in the <i>Mémoires
de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i>, and in the <i>Hist. of New York</i> by Yates and Moulton. In 1831 there
was a cut in Ira Hill’s <i>Antiquities of America explained</i> (Hagerstown, Md.) This was in effect the history
of the interest in the rock up to the appearance of Rafn’s <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>, in which for the first time
the inscription was represented as being the work of the Northmen. This belief is now shared by few, if
any, temperate students. The exuberant Anderson thinks that the rock removes all doubt of the Northmen
discovery (<i>America not discovered by Columbus</i>, pp. 21, 23, 83). The credulous Gravier has not a doubt.
Cf. his <i>Notice sur le roc de Dighton et le séjour des Scandinaves en Amérique au commencement du
XI<sup>e</sup> siècle</i> (Nancy, 1875), reprinted from the <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i>, i. 166, giving Rafn’s
drawing. The Rev. J. P. Bodfish accepts its evidence in the <i>Proc. Second Pub. Meeting U. S. Cath. Hist.
Soc.</i> (N. Y., 1886).</p>

<i>Pre-Columbian Discovery of America</i>, p. lvii. The <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, iii. 5378, gives Dammartin’s <i>Explification
de la Pierre de Taunston</i> (Paris? 1840-50) as finding in the inscription an astronomical theme by
some nation foreign to America. Buckingham Smith believed it to be a Roman Catholic invocation, around
which the Indians later put their symbols (<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Apr. 29, 1863, p. 32). For discussions
more or less extensive see Laing’s <i>Heimskringla</i>, i. 175; Haven in <i>Smithsonian Contributions</i>, 1856, viii.

Schoolcraft wavered in his opinion. (Cf. Haven, 133.) He showed Gooding’s drawing to an Algonkin
chief, who found in it a record of a battle of the Indians, except that some figures near the centre did not
belong to it, and these Schoolcraft thought might be runic, as De Costa has later suggested; but in 1853
Schoolcraft made no reservation in pronouncing it entirely Indian (<i>Indian Tribes</i>, i. 112; iv. 120; pl. 14).
Wilson (<i>Prehist. Man</i>, ii., ch. 19) is severe on Schoolcraft. On the general character of Indian rock
inscriptions,&mdash;some of which in the delineations accompanying these accounts closely resemble the Dighton
Rock,&mdash;see Mallery in the <i>Bureau of Ethnology, Fourth Report</i>, p. 19; Lieut. A. M. Wheeler’s Report on
Indian tribes in <i>Pacific Rail Road Reports</i>, ii.; J. G. Bruff on those of Green River in the Sierra Nevada, in

Vergleiche</i> (Stuttgard, 1878). It is Mallery’s opinion that no “considerable information of value in an historical
point of view will be obtained directly from the interpretations of the Pictographs in North America.”</p>

(<i>Views of Nature</i>, Bohn’s ed., 123). Ethnologists are not wholly agreed as to the course of their migrations.
The material for the ethnological study of the Eskimos must be looked for in the narratives of the Arctic
voyagers, like Scoresby, Parry, Ross, O’Reilly, Kane, C. F. Hall, and the rest; in the accounts by the missionaries
like Egede, Crantz, and others; by students of ethnology, like Lubbock (<i>Prehist. Times</i>, ch. 14); Prichard

Rink, born in 1819 in Copenhagen, spent much of the interval from 1853 to 1872 in Greenland. Pilling
(<i>Bibl. Eskimo Language</i>, p. 80) gives the best account of Rink’s publications. His principal book is <i>Grönland
geographisch und statistisch beschrieben</i> (Stuttgart, 1860). The English reader has access to his <i>Tales and
Traditions of the Eskimo</i>, translated by Rink himself, and edited by Dr. Robert Brown (London, 1875); to
<i>Danish Greenland, its people and its products</i>, ed. by Dr. Brown (London, 1877). Rink says of this work
that in its English dress it must be considered a new book. He also published <i>The Eskimo tribes; their
distribution and characteristics, especially in regard to language. With a comparative vocabulary</i> (Copenhagen,
etc., 1887). He also considered their dialects as divulging the relationship of tribes in the <i>Journal
of the Anthropological Institute</i> (xv. 239); and in the same journal (1872, p. 104) he has written of their descent.
Rink also furnished to the <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i>, a paper on the traditions of Greenland
(Nancy, 1875, ii. 181), and (Luxembourg, 1877, ii. 327) another on “L’habitat primitif des Esquimaux.”</p>

His book, <i>Det gamle Grönlands nye Perlustration</i>, etc., was first published at Copenhagen in 1729.
Pilling (<i>Bibliog. of the Eskimo language</i>, p. 26) was able to find only a single copy of this book, that in the
British Museum. Muller (<i>Books on America</i>, Amsterdam, 1872, no. 648) describes a copy. This first edition
escaped the notice of J. A. Allen, whose list is very carefully prepared (nos. 217, 220, 226, 230, 235). There
were two German editions of this original form of the book, Frankfort, 1730, and Hamburg, 1740, according
to the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> (ii. 448, 647), but Pilling gives only the first. The 1729 edition was enlarged
in the Copenhagen edition of 1741, which has a map, “Gronlandia Antiqua,” showing the east colony and
west colony, respectively, east and west of Cape Farewell. This edition is the basis of the various translations:
In German, Copenhagen, 1742, using the plates of the 1741 ed.; Berlin, 1763. In Dutch, Delft, 1746.
In French, Copenhagen, 1763. In English, London, 1745; abstracted in the <i>Philosoph. Transactions Royal
Soc.</i> (1744), xlii. no. 47; and again, London (1818), with an historical introduction based on Torfæus and La
Peyrère. Crantz epitomizes Egede’s career in Greenland.</p>
<p class="pfn4">The bibliography in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i> (vi. 22,018, etc.) confounds the Greenland journal (1770-78) of Hans
Egede’s grandson, Hans Egede Saabye (b. 1746; d. 1817), with the work of the grandfather. This journal is
of importance as regards the Eskimos and the missions among them. There is an English version: <i>Greenland:
extracts from a journal kept in 1770 to 1778. Prefixed an introduction; illus. by chart of Greenland,
by G. Fries. Transl. from the German</i> <i>[by H. E. Lloyd]</i> (London, 1818). The map follows that of
the son of Hans, Paul Egede, whose <i>Nachrichten von Grönland aus einem Tagebuche von Bischof Paul
Egede</i> (Copenhagen, 1790) must also be kept distinct. Pilling’s <i>Bibliog. of the Eskimo language</i> affords the
best guide.</p>

The original of Bardsen’s account has disappeared, but Rafn puts it in Latin, translating from an early
copy found in the Faröe Islands (<i>Antiquitates Américanæ</i>, p. 300). Purchas gives it in English, from a
copy which had belonged to Hudson, being translated from a Dutch version which Hudson had borrowed, the
Dutch being rendered by Barentz from a German version. Major also prints it in <i>Voyages of the Zeni</i>. He
recognizes in Bardsen’s “Gunnbiorn’s Skerries” the island which is marked in Ruysch’s map (1507) as blown
up in 1456 (see Vol. III. p. 9).</p>

In the seventeenth century there were a variety of symptoms of the English eagerness to get the claims of
Madoc substantiated, as in Sir Richard Hawkins’s <i>Observations</i> (Hakluyt Soc., 1847), and James Howell’s
<i>Familiar Letters</i> (London, 1645). Belknap (<i>Amer. Biog.</i>, 1794, i. p. 58) takes this view of Hakluyt’s purpose;
but Pinkerton, <i>Voyages</i>, 1812, xii. 157, thinks such a charge an aspersion. The subject was mentioned with some
particularity or incidentally by Purchas, Abbott (<i>Brief Description</i>, London, 1620, 1634, 1677), Smith (<i>Virginia</i>),
and Fox (<i>North-West Fox</i>). Sir Thomas Herbert in his <i>Relation of some Travaile into Africa and
Asia</i> (London, 1634) tracks Madoc to Newfoundland, and he also found Cymric words in Mexico, which
assured him in his search for further proofs (Bohn’s <i>Lowndes</i>, p. 1049; Carter-Brown, ii. 413, 1166).</p>
<p class="pfn4">The <i>Nieuwe en onbekende Weereld</i> of Montanus (Amsterdam, 1671) made the story more familiar. It
necessarily entered into the discussions of the learned men who, in the seventeenth century, were busied with
the question of the origin of the Americans, as in De Laet’s <i>Notæ ad dissertationem Hugonis Grotii</i> (Paris,
1643), who is inclined to believe the story, as is Hornius in his <i>De Originibus Americaniis</i> (1652).</p>

Nordenskjöld’s <i>Om bröderna Zenos resor och de äldsta kartor öfner Norden</i> was published at Stockholm
in 1883, as an address on leaving the presidency of the Swedish Academy, April 12, 1882; and in the same year,
at the Copenhagen meeting of the Congrès des Américanistes, he presented his <i>Trois Cartes précolumbiennes,
représentant une partie de l’Amérique</i> (Greenland), which included facsimiles of the Zeno (1558) and Donis
(1482) maps with that of Claudius Clavus (1427). This last represents “Islandia” lying midway alone in the
sea between “Norwegica Regio” and “Gronlandia provincia.” The “Congelatum mare” is made to flow north
of Norway, so as almost to meet the northern Baltic, while north of this frozen sea is an Arctic region, of which
Greenland is but an extension south and west. The student will find these and other maps making part of
the address already referred to, which also makes part in German of his <i>Studien und Forschungen veranlasst
durch meine Reisen im hohen Norden, autorisirte deutsche Ausgabe</i> (Leipzig, 1885). The maps accompanying
it not already referred to are the usual Ptolemy map of the north of Europe, based on a MS. of the
fourteenth century; the “Scandinavia” from the <i>Isolario</i> of Bordone, 1547; that of the world in the MS.
<i>Insularium illustratum</i> of Henricus Martellus, of the fifteenth century, in the British Museum, copied from
the sketch in José de Lacerda’s <i>Exame dos Viagens do Doutor Livingstone</i> (Lisbon, 1867); the “Scandinavia”
and the “Carta Marina” in the Venetian Ptolemy of 1548; the map of Olaus Magnus in 1567; the chart of
Andrea Bianco (1436); the map of the Basle ed. (1532) of Grynæus’ <i>Novis Orbis</i>; that of Laurentius Frisius
(1524). He gives these maps as the material possible to be used in 1558 in compiling a map, and to show the
superiority of the Zeno chart. Cf. <i>Nature</i>, xxviii. 14; and Major in <i>Royal Geog. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1883, p. 473.</p>

Dudley, <i>Arcano del Mare</i>, pl. lii, places Estotiland between Davis and Hudson’s Straits; but Torfæus
doubts if it is Labrador, as is “commonly believed.” Lafitau (<i>Mœurs des Sauvages</i>) puts it north of Hudson
Bay. Forster calls it Newfoundland. Beauvois (<i>Les colonies Européenes du Markland at de l’Escociland</i>)
makes it include Maine, New Brunswick, and part of Lower Canada. These are the chief varieties of belief.
Steenstrup is of those who do not recognize America at all. Hornius, among the older writers, thought that
Scotland or Shetland was more likely to have been the fisherman’s strange country. Santarem (<i>Hist. de la

Leardo (1448) at Venice.</p>

The recognition of the theory in the Mormon bible is well known. Bancroft (v. 97) epitomizes its recital,
following Bertrand’s <i>Mémoires</i>. There is a repetition of the old arguments in a sermon, <i>Increase of the Kingdom
of Christ</i> (N. Y., 1831), by the Indian William Apes; and in <i>An Address</i> by J. Madison Brown (Jackson,
Miss., 1860). Señor Melgar points out resemblances between the Maya and the Hebrew in the <i>Bol. Soc.
Méx. Geog.</i>, iii. Even the Western mounds have been made to yield Hebrew inscriptions (<i>Congrès des
Amér.</i>, Nancy, ii. 192).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Many of the general treatises on the origin of the Americans have set forth the opposing arguments.
Garcia did it fairly in his <i>Origen de los Indios</i> (1607; ed. by Barcia, 1729), and Bancroft (v. 78-84) has condensed
his treatment. Brasseur (<i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, i. 17) rejects the theory of the ten tribes; but is not inclined
to abandon a belief in some scattered traces. Short (pp. 135, 144) epitomizes the claims. Gaffarel covers
them in his <i>Etude sur les rapports de l’Amérique</i> (p. 87) with references, and these last are enlarged in Bancroft’s
<i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 95-97.</p>

Mauro’s map was called by Ramusio, who saw it, an
improved copy of one brought from Cathay by Marco
Polo. It is preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana at Venice.
It was made by Mauro under the command of Don Alonso
V., and Bianco assisted him. The exact date is in dispute;
but all agree to place it between 1457 and 1460. A copy
was made on vellum in 1804, which is now in the British
Museum. Our cut follows one corner of the reproduction
in Santarem’s <i>Atlas</i>. A photographic fac-simile has been
issued in Venice by Ongania, and St. Martin (<i>Atlas</i>, p. vii)
follows this fac-simile. Ruge (<i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der
Entdeckungen</i>) gives a modernized and more legible reproduction.

Rafn gives a large map of Iceland with the names of
a.d. 1000. On the errors of early and late maps of Iceland

application of the name Thule, Thyle, etc., to the northern

<i>Ultima Thule, a Summer in Iceland</i> (London, 1875),

Greenland (Grotlandia) is simply a neck connecting Europe
with America; and in Gastaldi “Carta Marina,” in the
Italian Ptolemy of 1548, where it is a protuberance on a
similar neck (see Vol. II. 435; IV. 43; and Nordenskjöld’s

the same material used by Mercator in his gores, but he
adds a new confusion in calling Greenland the “Cost of
Labrador.” Cf. Winsor’s <i>Kohl Maps</i>, no. 104. The

The earliest fixed date for the founding
of Tenochtitlan (Mexico city) is 1325. Brasseur
tells us that Carlos de Sigüenza y Gongora
made the first chronological table of ancient
Mexican dates, which was used by Boturini, and
was improved by Leon y Gama,&mdash;the same
which Bustamante has inserted in his edition of
Gomara. Gallatin (<i>Amer. Ethnol. Soc. Trans.</i>, i.)
gave a composite table of events by dates before
the Conquest, which is followed in Brantz
Mayer’s <i>Mexico as it was</i>, i. 97. Ed. Madier de
Montjau, in his <i>Chronologie hiéroglyphico-phonétique
des Rois Astéques de 1352 à 1522</i>, takes
issue with Ramirez on some points.</p>

Bancroft (v. 199) gives references to those
writers who have discussed this question of giants.
Bandelier’s references are more in detail
(<i>Arch. Tour</i>, p. 201). Short (p. 233) borrows
largely the list in Bancroft. The enumeration
includes nearly all the old writers. Acosta finds
confirmation in bones of incredible largeness,
often found in his day, and then supposed to be
human. Modern zoölogists say they were those
of the Mastodon. Howarth, <i>Mammoth and the

Sometimes it is said they came from the
Antilles, or beyond, easterly, and that an off-shoot
of the same people appeared to the early
French, explorers as the Natchez Indians. We
have, of course, offered to us a choice of theories
in the belief that the Maya civilization came
from the westward by the island route from
Asia. This misty history is nothing without
alternatives, and there are a plenty of writers
who dogmatize about them.</p>

wandered south to Peru. There are some stories
of even pre-Votan days, under Igh and
Imox. Cf. H. De Charency’s “Myth d’Imos,”

Bancroft (v. 236) points to Bradford, Squier,
Tylor, Viollet-le-Duc, Bartlett, and Müller, with
Brasseur in a qualified way, as in the main agreeing
in this early disjointing of the Nashua stock,
by which the Maya was formed through separation
from the older race.</p>

We sometimes find it written Mayab. It is

the Quiché-Cakchiquels of Guatemala and those
of Nicaragua, under the comprehensive term of
Maya, as distinct from the Nahua people farther
north.</p>

Brinton, with his view of myths, speaks of
the attempt of the Abbé Brasseur to make Xibalba
an ancient kingdom, with Palenqué as its

Perhaps by Gucumatz (who is identified by
some with Quetzalcoatl), leading the Tzequiles,
who are said to have appeared from somewhere
during one of Votan’s absences, and to have
grown into power among the Chanes, or Votan’s
people, till they made Tulan, where they lived,
too powerful for the Votanites. Bancroft (v.
187) holds this view against Brasseur.</p>

Kirk says (Prescott’s <i>Mexico</i>): “Confusion
arises from the name of Chichimec, originally
that of a single tribe, and subsequently of its
many offshoots, being also used to designate successive
hordes of whatever race.” Some have
seen in the Waiknas of the Mosquito Coast, and
in the Caribs generally, descendants of these Chichimecs
who have kept to their old social level.
The Caribs, on other authority, came originally
from the stock of the Tupis and Guaranis, who
occupied the region south of the Amazon, and
in Columbus’s time they were scattered in Darien
and Honduras, along the northern regions
of South America, and in some of the Antilles
(Von Martius, <i>Beiträge sur Ethnographie and
Sprachenkunde Amerika’s zumal Brasilìens</i>,
Leipzig, 1867). Bancroft (ii. 126) gives the
etymology of Chichimec and of other tribal designations.
Cf. Buschmann’s <i>Ueber die Aztekischen
Ortsnamen</i> (Berlin, 1853). Bandelier (<i>Archæol.
Tour</i>, 200; <i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i>, ii. 393)
says he fails to discover in the word anything
more than a general term, signifying a savage, a
hunter, or a warrior, Chichimecos, applied to
roving tribes. Brasseur says that Mexican tradition
applies the term Chichimecs generically
to the first occupants of the New World.</p>

These names wander and exchange consonants
provokingly, and it may be enough to give
alphabetically a list comprised of those in Prichard
(<i>Nat. Hist. Man</i>) and Orozco y Berra (<i>Geografía</i>),
with some help from Gallatin in the
<i>American Ethno. Soc. Trans.</i>, i., and other
groupers of the ethnological traces: Chinantecs,
Chatinos, Cohuixcas, Chontales, Colhuas, Coras,
Cuitatecs, Chichimecs, Cuextecas (Guaxtecas,
Huastecs), Mazetecs, Mazahuas, Michinacas,
Miztecs, Nonohualcas, Olmecs, Otomís, Papabucos,
Quinames, Soltecos, Totonacs, Triquis,
Tepanecs, Tarascos, Xicalancas, Zapotecs. It
is not unlikely the same people may be here
mentioned under different names. The diversity
of opinions respecting the future of these vapory
existences is seen in Bancroft’s collation (v.
202). Torquemada tells us about all that we
know of the Totonacs, who claim to have been
the builders of Teotihuacan. Bancroft gives references
(v. 204) for the Totonacs, (p. 206) for
the Otomís, (p. 207) for the Mistecs and Zapotecs,
and (p. 208) for the Huastecs.</p>

Cf. Kirk in Prescott, i. 10. It must be confessed
that it is rather in the domain of myth
than of history that we must place all that has
been written about the scattering of the Toltec
people at Babel (Bancroft, v. 19), and their
finally reaching Huehue-Tlapallan, wherever
that may have been. The view long prevalent
about this American starting-point of the Nahuas,
Toltecs, or whatever designation may be
given to the beginners of this myth and history,
placed it in California, but some later writers
think it worth while to give it a geographical
existence in the Mississippi Valley, and to associate
it in some vague way with the moundbuilders
and their works (Short, <i>No. Amer. of
Antiq.</i>, 251, 253). There is some confusion between
Huehue-Tlapallan of this story and the
Tlapallan noticed in the Spanish conquest time,
which was somewhere in the Usumacinta region,
and if we accept Tollan, Tullan, or Tula as a
form of the name, the confusion is much increased
(Short, pp. 217-220). Bancroft (v. 214)
says there is no sufficient data to determine the
position of Huehue-Tlapallan, but he thinks “the
evidence, while not conclusive, favors the south
rather than the north” (p. 216). The truth is,
about these conflicting views of a northern or
southern origin, pretty much as Kirk puts it
(Prescott, i. 18): “All that can be said with confidence
is, that neither of the opposing theories
rests on a secure and sufficient basis.” The
situation of Huehue-Tlapallan and Aztlan is
very likely one and the same question, as looking
to what was the starting-point of all the
Nahua migrations, extending over a thousand
years.</p>

In support of the California location, Buschmann,
in his <i>Ueber die Spuren der Aztekischen
Sprache im nördlichen Mexico und höheren Amerikanischen
Norden</i> (Berlin, 1854), finds traces of
the Mexican tongue in those of the recent California
Indians. Linguistic resemblances to the
Aztec, even so far north as Nootka, have been
traced, but later philologists deny the inferences
of relationship drawn from such similarity (Bancroft,
iii. p. 612). The linguistic confusion in
aboriginal California is so great that there is a
wide field for tracing likenesses (<i>Ibid.</i> iii. 635).
In the <i>California State Mining Bureau, Bulletin
no. 1</i> (Sacramento, 1888), Winslow Anderson
gives a description of some desiccated human
remains found in a sealed cave, which are supposed
to be Aztec. There are slight resemblances
to the Aztec in the Shoshone group of
languages (Bancroft, iii. 660), and the same author
arranges all that has been said to connect
the Mexican tongue with those of New Mexico
and neighboring regions (iii. 664). Buschmann,
who has given particular attention to tracing the
Aztec connections at the north, finds nothing to
warrant anything more than casual admixtures
with other stocks (<i>Die Lautveränderung Aztekischer
Wörter</i>, Berlin, 1855, and <i>Die Spuren der
Aztekischen Sprachen</i>, Berlin, 1859). See Short
(p. 487) for a summary.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_820_820" id="Footnote_820_820"></a><a href="#FNanchor_820_820"><span class="label">[820]</span></a></span>
Bancroft (v. 305) cites the diverse views; so
does Short to some extent (pp. 246, 258, etc.).
Cf. Brinton’s <i>Address</i> on “Where was Aztlan?”
p. 6; Short, 486, 490; Nadaillac, 284; Wilson’s
<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. 327.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Brinton (<i>Myths of the New World</i>, etc., 89;
<i>Amer. Hero. Myths</i>, 92) holds that Aztlan is a
name wholly of mythical purport, which it would
be vain to seek on the terrestrial globe. This
cradle region of the Nahuas sometimes appears
as the Seven Caves (Chicomoztoc), and Duran
places them “in Teoculuacan, otherwise called
Aztlan, a country toward the north and connected
with Florida.” The Seven Caves were
explained by Sahagún as a valley, by Clavigero
as a city, by Schoolcraft and others as simply
seven boats in which the first comers came from
Asia; Brasseur makes them and Aztlan the
same; others find them to be the seven cities of
Cibola,&mdash;so enumerates Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, 227),
who thinks that the seven divisions of the Nahuas
sprung from the belief in the Seven Caves,
and had in reality no existence.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Gallatin has followed out the series of migrations
in the <i>Amer. Ethnol. Soc. Trans.</i>, i. 162.
Dawson, <i>Fossil Men</i> (ch. 3), gives his comprehensive
views of the main directions of these
early migrations. Brasseur follows the Nahuas
(<i>Popul Vuh</i>, introd., sect. ix.). Winchell (<i>Pre-Adamites</i>)
thinks the general tendency was from
north to south. Morgan finds the origin of the
Mexican tribes in New Mexico and in the San
Juan Valley (<i>Peabody Mus. Rept.</i>, xii. 553. Cf.
his article in the <i>North Am. Rev.</i>, Oct., 1869).
Humboldt (<i>Views of Nature</i>, 207) touches the
Aztec wanderings.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are two well-known Aztec migration
maps, first published in F. G. Carreri’s <i>Giro
del Mondo</i>; in English as “Voyage round the
world,” in Churchill’s <i>Voyages</i>, vol. iv., concerning
which see Bancroft, ii. 543; iii. 68, 69; Short,
262, 431, 433; Prescott, iii. 364, 382. Orozco y
Berra (<i>Hist. Antiq. de Mexico</i>, iii. 61) says that
these maps follow one another, and are not different
records of the same progress. Humboldt
(<i>Vues</i>, etc., ii. 176) gives an interpretation of
them in accordance with Sigüenza’s views, which
is the one usually followed, and Bancroft (v. 324)
epitomizes it. Ramirez says that the copies
reproduced in Humboldt, Clavigero, and Kingsborough
are not so correct as the engraving
given in Garcia y Cubas’s <i>Atlas geogrâfico, estadistico
e histórico de la Republica Mejicana</i> (April,
1858). Bancroft (ii. 544) gives it as reproduced
by Ramirez. It is also in the Mexican edition
of Prescott, and in Schoolcraft’s <i>Indian Tribes</i>.
Cf. Delafield’s <i>Inquiry</i> (N. Y., 1839) and Léon
de Rosny’s <i>Les doc. écrits de l’antiq. Amér.</i>
(Paris, 1882). The original is preserved in
the Museo Nacional of Mexico. A palm-tree
on the map, near Aztlan, has pointed some of
the arguments in favor of a southern position
for that place, but Ramirez says it is but a part
of a hieroglyphic name, and has no reference
to the climate of Aztlan (Short, p. 266). F. Von
Hellwald printed a paper on “American migrations,”
with notes by Professor Henry, in the
<i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1866, pp. 328-345. Short
defines as “altogether the most enlightened
treatment of the subject” the paper of John
H. Becker, “Migrations des Nahuas,” in the
<i>Compte rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i> (Luxembourg,
1877), i. 325. This paper finds an
identification of the Tulan Zuiva of the Quichés,
the Huehue-Tlapallan of the Toltecs, the Amaquemecan
of the Chichimecs, and the Oztotlan
(Aztlan) of the Aztecs in The valleys of the Rio
Grande del Norte and Rio Colorado, as was
Morgan’s view. Short (p. 249) summarizes his
paper. Bancroft (v. 289) shows the diversity
of views respecting Amaquemecan.</p>

<i>Native Races</i>, v. 167, recapitulates the proofs
against the northern theory. J. R. Bartlett, <i>Personal
Narrative</i>, ii. 283, finds no evidence for it.
The successive sites of their sojourns as they
passed on their journeys are given as Tlapallan,
Tlacutzin, Tlapallanco, Jalisco, Atenco, Iztachnexuca,
Tollatzinco, Tollan or Tula,&mdash;the last,
says Bancroft, apparently in Chiapas. If there
was not such confusion respecting the old geography,
these names might decide the question.</p>

Writers usually place the beginnings of credible
history at about this period. Brasseur and
the class of writers who are easily lifted on their
imagination talk about traces of a settled government
being discernible at periods which they
place a thousand years before Christ.</p>

If one wants the details of all this, he can
read it in Veytia, Brasseur (<i>Nat. Civilisées</i> and
<i>Palenqué</i>, ch. viii.), and Bancroft, the latter giving
references (v. 285).</p>

It is frequently stated that there was a segregated
migration to Central America. Bancroft
(v. 168, 285), who collates the authorities, finds
nothing of the kind implied. He thinks the
mass remained in Anáhuac. The old view as
expressed by Prescott (i. 14) was that “much
the greater number probably spread over the
region of Central America and the neighboring
isles, and the traveller now speculates on the
majestic ruins of Mitla and Palenqué as possibly
the work of this extraordinary people.”
Kirk, as Prescott’s editor, refers to the labors
of Orozco y Berra (<i>Geografía de las Lenguas de
México</i>, 122), followed by Tylor, (<i>Anahuac</i>, 189)
as establishing the more recent view that this
southern architecture, “though of a far higher
grade, was long anterior to the Toltec dominion.”</p>

Bancroft (v. 287) says: “It is probable that
the name Toltec, a title of distinction rather
than a national name, was never applied at all
to the common people.”</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_829_829" id="Footnote_829_829"></a><a href="#FNanchor_829_829"><span class="label">[829]</span></a></span>
Brinton’s main statement is in his <i>Were the
Toltecs an historic nationality? Read before the
American Philosophical Society, Sept. 2, 1887</i>
(Phila., 1887); published also in their <i>Proceedings</i>,
1887, p. 229. Cf. also Brinton’s <i>Amer.
Hero. Myths</i> (Phil., 1882), p. 86, where he throws
discredit on the existence of the alleged Toltec
king Quetzalcoatl (whom Sahagún keeps distinct
from the mythical demi-god); and earlier,
in his <i>Myths of the New World</i> (p. 29), he had
suggested that the name Toltec might have “a
merely mythical signification.” Charnay, who
makes the Toltecs a Nahuan tribe, had defended
their historical status in a paper on “La Civilisation
Tolteque,” in the <i>Revue d’Ethnographie</i>
(iv., 1885); and again, two years later, in the same
periodical, he reviewed adversely Brinton’s arguments.
(Cf. <i>Saturday Review</i>, lxiii. 843.) Otto
Stoll, in his <i>Guatemala, Reisen und Schilderungen</i>
(Leipzig, 1886), is another who rejects the old
theory.</p>

<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 7. Sahagún identifies the
Toltecs with the “giants,” and if these were the
degraded descendants of the followers of Votan,
Sahagún thus earlier established the same identity.</p>

<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 191.  The fact that the
names which we associate with the Toltecs are
Nahua, only means that Nahua writers have
transmitted them, as Bandelier thinks. Cf. also
Bandelier’s citation in the <i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>,
vol. ii. 388, where he speaks of our information
regarding the Toltecs as “limited and obscure.”
He thinks it beyond question that they were Nahuas;
and the fact that their division of time
corresponds with the system found in Yucatan,
Guatemala, etc., with other evidences of myths
and legends, leads him to believe that the aborigines
of more southern regions were, if not descendants,
at least of the same stock with the
Toltecs, and that we are justified in studying
them to learn what the Toltecs were. He finds
that Veytia, in his account of the Toltecs, beside
depending on Sahagún and Torquemada, finds a
chief source in Ixtlilxochitl, and locates Huehue-Tlapallan
in the north; and Veytia’s statements
reappear in Clavigero.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The best narratives of the Toltec history are
those in Veytia, <i>Historia Antigua de Méjico</i> (Mexico,
1806); Brasseur’s <i>Hist. Nations Civilisées</i>
(vol. i.), and his introduction to his <i>Popul Vuh</i>;
and Bancroft (v. ch. 3 and 4): but we must look
to Ixtlilxochitl, Torquemada, Sahagún, and the
others, if we wish to study the sources. In such
a study we shall encounter vexatious problems
enough. It is practically impossible to arrange
chronologically what Ixtlilxochitl says that he
got from the picture-writings which he interpreted.
Bancroft (v. 209) does the best he can
to give it a forced perspicuity. Wilson (<i>Prehisoric
Man</i>, i. 245) not inaptly says: “The history
of the Toltecs and their ruined edifices stands
on the border line of romance and fable, like
that of the ruined builders of Carnac and Avebury.”</p>

Short (page 255) points out that Bancroft
unadvisedly looks upon these Chichimecs as of
Nahua stock, according to the common belief.
Short thinks that Pimentel (<i>Lenguas indigenas
de México</i>, published in 1862) has conclusively
shown that the Chichimecs did not originally
speak the Nahua tongue, but subsequently
adopted it. Short (page 256) thinks, after collating
the evidence, that it is impossible to determine
whence or how they came to Anáhuac.</p>

These events are usually one thing or
another, according to the original source which
you accept, as Bancroft shows (v. 303). The

On the nature of the Mexican confederacy
see Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>, ii. 416).
He enumerates the authorities upon the point
that no one of the allied tribes exercised any
powers over the others beyond the exclusive
military direction of the Mexicans proper (<i>Peabody
Mus. Reports</i>, ii. 559). Orozco y Berra
(<i>Geografía</i>, etc.) claims that there was a tendency
to assimilate the conquered people to the Mexican
conditions. Bandelier claims that “no attempt,
either direct or implied, was made to
assimilate or incorporate them.” He urges that
nowhere on the march to Mexico did Cortés fall
in with Mexican rulers of subjected tribes. It
does not seem to be clear in all cases whether it
was before or after the confederation was formed,
or whether it was by the Mexicans or Tezcucans
that Tecpaneca, Xochimilca, Cuitlahuac, Chalco,
Acolhuacan, and Quauhnahuac, were conquered.

Sometimes written Mochtheuzema, Moktezema.
The Aztec Montezuma must not, as is
contended, be confounded with the hero-god of
the New Mexicans. Cf. Bancroft, iii. 77, 171;

This has induced some historians to call
these wars “holy wars.” Bandelier discredits
wholly the common view, that wars were undertaken
to secure victims for the sacrificial stone
(<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 24). But in another place (<i>Peabody
Mus. Reports</i>, ii. 128) he says: “War was
required for the purpose of obtaining human victims,
their religion demanding human sacrifices
at least eighteen times every year.”</p>

As to these carvings, which have not yet
wholly disappeared, see <i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>,

of Montezuma II. in Vol. II. 361, 363, and that

Brinton’s <i>Amer. Hero Myths</i>, 139, etc. See,
on the prevalence of the idea of the return at
some time of the hero-god, Brinton’s <i>Myths of
the New World</i>, p. 160. “We must remember,”
he says, “that a fiction built on an idea is infinitely
more tenacious of life than a story founded
on fact.” Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, 188) gathers from
Gomara, Cogolludo, Villagutierre, and others,
instances to show how prevalent in America was
the presentiment of the arrival and domination
of a white race,&mdash;a belief still prevailing among
their descendants of the middle regions of America
who watch for the coming of Montezuma
(<i>Ibid.</i> p. 190). Brinton does not seem to recognize
the view held by many that the Montezuma
of the Aztecs was quite a different being from
the demi-god of the Pueblas of New Mexico.</p>

It is not easy to reconcile the conflicting
statements of the native historians respecting
the course of events during the Aztec supremacy,
such is the mutual jealousy of the Mexican
and Tezcucan writers. Brasseur has satisfied
himself of the authenticity of a certain sequence
and character of events (<i>Nations Civilisées</i>), and
Bancroft simply follows him (v. 401). Veytia is
occupied more with the Tezcucans than with the
Aztecs. The condensed sketch here given follows
the main lines of the collated records. We
find good pictures of the later history of Mexico
and Tlascala, before the Spaniards came,
in Prescott (i. book 2d, ch. vi., and book 3d, ch.
ii.). Bancroft (v. ch. 10) with his narrative and
references helps us out with the somewhat monotonous
details of all the districts of Mexico
which were outside the dominance of the Mexican
valley, as of Cholula, Tlascala, Michoacan,
and Oajaca, with the Miztecs and Zapotecs, inhabiting
this last province.</p>

The Maya calendar and astronomical system,
as the basis of the Maya chronology, is explained
in the version which Perez gave into
Spanish of a Maya manuscript (translated into
English by Stephens in his <i>Yucatan</i>), and which
Valentini has used in his “Katunes of Maya
History,” in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, Oct.
1879. On the difficulties of the subject see Brasseur’s
<i>Nations Civilisées</i> (ii. ch. 1). Cf. also his
<i>Landa</i>, section xxxix., and page 366, from the
“Cronologia antigua de Yucatan.” Cf. further,

as marked for perspicacity, deep knowledge,
and honest judgment, speaks of it as embodying
the experience of nearly twenty years,&mdash;eleven
of which were passed in Mexico,&mdash;and
in which the author gave answers to inquiries
put by the king. “If we could obtain,” says
Bandelier, “all the answers given to these questions
from all parts of Spanish America, and all
as elaborate and truthful as those of Zurita, Palacio,
and Ondegardo, our knowledge of the aboriginal
history and ethnology of Spanish America
would be much advanced.” Zurita’s Report

It is much we owe to the twelve Franciscan
friars who on May 13, 1524, landed in Mexico to
convert and defend the natives. It is from their
writings that we must draw a large part of our
knowledge respecting the Indian character, condition,
and history. These Christian apostles
were Martin de Valencia, Francisco de Soto,
Martin de Coruña, Juan Xuares, Antonio de
Ciudad Rodrigo, Toribio de Benavente, Garcia
de Cisneros, Luis de Fuensalida, Juan de Ribas,
Francisco Ximenez, Andrés de Cordoba, Juan

This is true of Acosta and Davila Padilla.
The bibliography of Acosta has been given elsewhere
(Vol. II. p. 420). His books v., vi., and
vii. cover the ancient history of the country.
He used the MSS. of Duran (Brasseur, <i>Bibl.
Mex.-Guat.</i>, p. 2), and his correspondence with
Tobar, preserved in the Lenox library, has been
edited by Icazbalceta in his <i>Don Fray Zumárraga</i>
(Mexico, 1881). Of the <i>Provincia de Santiago</i>
and the <i>Varia historia</i> of Davila Padilla,
the bibliography has been told in another place.

Properly, Bernardino Ribeira; named from
his birthplace, Sahagún, in Spain. Chavero’s

A few data can be added to the account of
Sahagún given in Vol. II. p. 415. J. F. Ramirez
completes the bibliography of Sahagún in the
<i>Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia de
Madrid</i>, vi. 85 (1885). Icazbalceta, having told
the story of Sahagún’s life in his edition of
Mendieta’s <i>Hist. Eclesiastica Indiana</i> (México,
1870), has given an extended critical and bibliographical
account in his <i>Bibliografía Mexicana</i>
(México, 1886), vol. i. 247-308. Other bibliographical
detail can be gleaned from Pilling’s
<i>Proof-sheets</i>, p. 677, etc.; Icazbalceta’s <i>Apuntes</i>;
Beristain’s <i>Biblioteca</i>; the <i>Bibliotheca Mexicana</i>
of Ramirez. The list in Adolfo Llanos’s <i>Sahagún
y su historia de México</i> (<i>Museo Nac. de Méx.
Anales</i>, iii., pt. 3, p. 71) is based chiefly on Alfredo
Chavero’s <i>Sahagún</i> (México, 1877). Brasseur
de Bourbourg, in his <i>Palenqué</i> (ch. 5), has
explained the importance of what Brevoort calls
Sahagún’s “great encyclopædia of the Mexican
Empire.” Rosny (<i>Les documents écrits de l’Antiquité
Américaine</i>, p. 69) speaks of seeing a
copy of the <i>Historia</i> in Madrid, accompanied by
remarkable Aztec pictures. Bancroft, referring
to the defective texts of Sahagún in Kingsborough
and Bustamante, says: “Fortunately what
is missing in one I have always found in the
other.” He further speaks of the work of Sahagún
as “the most complete and comprehensive,
so far as aboriginal history is concerned, furnishing
an immense mass of material, drawn from
native sources, very badly arranged and written.”
Eleven books of Sahagún are given to the social
institutions of the natives, and but one to the
conquest. Jourdanet’s edition is mentioned elsewhere
(Vol. II.).</p>

Those who used him most, like Clavigero
and Brasseur de Bourbourg, complain of this.
Torquemada, says Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus.
Repts.</i> ii. 119), “notwithstanding his unquestionable
credulity, is extremely important on all questions
of Mexican antiquities.”</p>

Bancroft, <i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 147; Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric
Man</i>, i. 325. It must be confessed that
with no more authority than the old Mexican
paintings, interpreted through the understanding
of old men and their traditions, Ixtlilxochitl
has not the firmest ground to walk on. Aubin
thinks that Ixtlilxochitl’s confusion and contradictions
arise from his want of patience in studying
his documents; and some part of it may
doubtless have arisen from his habit, as Brasseur
says (<i>Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne</i>, May,
1855, p. 329), of altering his authorities to magnify
the glories of his genealogic line. Max
Müller (<i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>, i. 322)
says of his works: “Though we must not expect
to find in them what we are accustomed to
call history, they are nevertheless of great historical
interest, as supplying the vague outlines
of a distant past, filled with migrations, wars,
dynasties and revolutions, such as were cherished
in the memory of the Greeks in the time of Solon.”
In addition to his <i>Historia Chichimeca</i>
and his <i>Relaciones</i>, (both of which are given by
Kingsborough, while Ternaux has translated portions,)&mdash;the
MS. of the <i>Relaciones</i> being in the
Mexican archives,&mdash;Ixtlilxochitl left a large
mass of his manuscript studies of the antiquities,
often repetitionary in substance. Some are
found in the compilation made in Mexico by
Figueroa in 1792, by order of the Spanish government
(Prescott, i. 193). Some were in the
Ramirez collection. Quaritch (<i>MS. Collections</i>,
Jan., 1888, no. 136) held one from that collection,
dated about 1680, at £16, called <i>Sumaria Relacion</i>,
which concerned the ancient Chichimecs.
Those which are best known are a <i>Historia de la
Nueva España</i>, or <i>Historia del Reyno de Tezcuco</i>,
and a <i>Historia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</i>,
if this last is by him.</p>

We owe to him descriptions at this time of

Robertson was inclined to disparage Clavigero’s
work, asserting that he could find little
in him beyond what he took from Acosta and
Herrera “except the improbable narratives and
fanciful conjectures of Torquemada and Boturini.”
Clavigero criticised Robertson, and the
English historian in his later editions replied.
Prescott points out (i. 70) that Clavigero only
knew Sahagún through the medium of Torquemada
and later writers. Bancroft (<i>Nat. Races</i>, v.
149; <i>Mexico</i>, i. 700) thinks that Clavigero “owes
his reputation much more to his systematic arrangement
and clear narration of traditions that
had before been greatly confused, and to the
omission of the most perplexing and contradictory
points, than to deep research or new discoveries.”</p>

He had collected nearly 500 Mexican paintings
in all. Aubin (<i>Notices</i>, etc., p. 21) says
that Boturini nearly exhausted the field in his
searches, and with the collection of Sigüenza he
secured all those cited by Ixtlilxochitl and the
most of those concealed by the Indians,&mdash;of
which mention is made by Torquemada, Sahagún,
Valadés, Zurita, and others; and that the
researches of Bustamante, Cubas, Gondra, and
others, up to 1851, had not been able to add
much of importance to what Boturini possessed.</p>

<i>Notice sur une collection d’antiquités Mexicaines,
being an extract from a Mémoire sur la
peinture didactique et l’Écriture figurative des
Anciens Mexicains</i> (Paris, 1851; again, 1859-1861).
Cf. papers in <i>Revue Américaine et Orientale</i>,
1st ser., iii., iv., and v. Aubin says that
Humboldt found that part of the Boturini collection
which had been given over to the Mexican
archivists diminished by seven eighths. He
also shows how Ternaux-Compans (<i>Crauatés
Horribles</i>, p. 275-289), Rafael Isidro Gondra (in
Veytia, <i>Hist. Ant. de Mex.</i>, 1836, i. 49), and Bustamante
have related the long contentions over
the disposition of these relics, and how the Academy
of History at Madrid had even secured the
suppression of a similar academy among the
antiquaries in Mexico, which had been formed
to develop the study of their antiquities. It was
as a sort of peace-offering that the Spanish
king now caused Veytia to be empowered to
proceed with the work which Boturini had begun.
This allayed the irritation for a while, but
on Veytia’s death (1769) it broke out again, when
Gama was given possession of the collection,
which he further increased. It was at Gama’s
death sold at auction, when Humboldt bought
the specimens which are now in Berlin, and
Waldeck secured others which he took to Europe.
It was from Waldeck that Aubin acquired
the Boturini part of his collection. The
rest of the collection remained in Mexico, and
in the main makes a part at present of the Museo
Nacional. But Aubin is a doubtful witness.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Aubin says that he now proposed to refashion
the Boturini collection by copies where he could
not procure the originals; to add others, embracing
whatever he could still find in the hands
of the native population, and what had been
collected by Veytia, Gama, and Pichardo. In
1851, when he wrote, Aubin had given twenty
years to this task, and with what results the list
of his MSS., which he appends to the account
we have quoted, will show.</p>
<p class="pfc4">These include in the native tongue:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>a.</i> History of Mexico from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1064 to 1521,
in fragments, from Tezozomoc and from Alonso
Franco, annotated by Domingo Chimalpain (a
copy).</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>b.</i> Annals of Mexico, written apparently in
1528 by one who had taken part in the defence
of Mexico (an original).</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>c.</i> Several historical narratives on European
paper, by Domingo Chimalpain, coming down
to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1591, which have in great part been
translated by Aubin, who considers them the
most important documents which we possess.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>d.</i> A history of Colhuacan and Mexico, lacking
the first leaf. This is described as being
in the handwriting of Ixtlilxochitl, and Aubin
gives the dates of its composition as 1563 and
1570. It is what has later been known as the
<i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>e.</i> Zapata’s history of Tlaxcalla.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>f.</i> A copy by Loaysa of an original, from
which Torquemada has copied several chapters.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_904_904" id="Footnote_904_904"></a><a href="#FNanchor_904_904"><span class="label">[904]</span></a></span>
The chief of the Boturini acquisition he
enumerates as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>a.</i> Toltec annals on fifty leaves of European
paper, cited by Gama in his <i>Descripcion histórica</i>.
Cf. Brasseur, <i>Nations Civilisées</i>, p. lxxvi.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>b.</i> Chichimec annals, on Indian paper, six
leaves, of which ten pages consist of pictures,
the original so-called <i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i>, of
which Gama made a copy, also in the Aubin collection,
as well as Ixtlilxochitl’s explanation of
it. Aubin says that he has used this account of
Ixtlilxochitl to rectify that historian’s blunders.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>c.</i> Codex on Indian paper, having a picture of
the Emperor Xolotl.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>d.</i> A painting on prepared skin, giving the
genealogy of the Chichimecan chiefs, accompanied
by the copies made by Pichardo and
Boturini. Cf. <i>Archives de la Soc. Amér. de
France</i>, 2d ser., i. 283.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>e.</i> A synchronical history of Tepechpan and of
Mexico, on Indian paper, accompanied by a
copy made by Pichardo and an outline sketch
of that in the Museo Nacional.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Without specifying others which Aubin enumerates,
he gives as other acquisitions the following
in particular:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>a.</i> Pichardo’s copy of a Codex Mexicanus,
giving the history of the Mexicans from their
leaving Aztlan to 1590.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>b.</i> An original Mexican history from the departure
from Aztlan to 1569.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>c.</i> Fragments which had belonged to Sigüenza.</p>

1888, no. 171), and some of his unpublished
notes on Prescott, not included in those “notas y
ecclarecimientos” appended to Navarro’s translation
of the <i>Conquest of Mexico</i> (<i>Catal.</i>, 1885,
no. 28,502). The several publications of Léon
de Rosny point us to scattered specimens. In
his <i>Doc. écrits de l’Antiquité Amér.</i> he gives the
fac-simile of a colored Aztec map. A MS. in
the collection of the Corps Legislatif, in Paris,
and that of the Codex Indiæ Meridionalis are
figured in his <i>Essai sur le déchiffrement, etc.</i> (pl.
ix, x). In the <i>Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France,
n. s.</i>, vol. i., etc., we find plates of the Mappe
Tlotzin, and a paper of Madier de Montjau,
“sur quelques manuscrits figuratifs de l’Ancien
Méxique.” Cf. also <i>Anales del Museo</i>, viii.</p>

This was in 1843, when Stephens made his
English translation from Pio Perez’s Spanish
version, <i>Antigua Chronologia Yucateca</i>; and
from Stephens’s text, Brasseur gave it a French
rendering in his edition of Landa. (Cf. also his
<i>Nat. Civilisées</i>, ii. p. 2.) Perez, who in Stephens’s
opinion (<i>Yucatan</i>, ii. 117) was the best Maya
scholar in that country, made notes, which Valentini
published in his “Katunes of Maya History,”
in the <i>Pro. of the Amer. Antiq. Soc.</i>, Oct., 1879
(Worcester, 1880), but they had earlier been
printed in Carrillo’s <i>Hist. y Geog. de Yucatan</i>
(Merida, 1881). Bancroft (<i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 624)
reprints Stephens’s text with notes from Brasseur.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The books of Chilan Balam were used both
by Cogolludo and Lizana; and Brasseur printed
some of them in the <i>Mission Scientifique au
Méxique</i>. They are described in Carrillo’s <i>Disertacion
sobre la historia de lengua Maya ó Yucateca</i>

The second edition was called <i>Los tres Siglos
de la Dominacion Española en Yucatan</i> (Campeche
and Merida, 2 vols., 1842, 1845). It was
edited unsatisfactorily by Justo Sierra. Cf. Vol.
II. p. 429; Brasseur, <i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>, p. 47.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This, like Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor’s
<i>Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el
Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon,
y otras naciones de Indios Barbaros, de la mediacion
de el Reyno de Gautimala, a las Provincias
de Yucatan, en la America Septentrional</i> (Madrid,
1701), (which, says Bandelier, is of importance
for that part of Yucatan which has remained unexplored),
has mostly to do with the Indians
under the Spanish rule, but the books are not
devoid of usefulness in the study of the early
tribes.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the modern comments on the Yucatan ancient
history, those of Brasseur in his <i>Nations
Civilisées</i> are more to be trusted than his introduction
to his edition of Landa, which needs
to be taken with due recognition of his later
vagaries; and Brinton has studied their history
at some length in the introduction to his <i>Maya
Chronicles</i>. The first volume of Eligio Ancona’s
<i>Hist. de Yucatan</i> covers the early period. See
Vol. II. p. 429. Brinton calls it “disappointingly
superficial.” There is much that is popularly
retrospective in the various and not always
stable contributions of Dr. Le Plongeon and
his wife. The last of Mrs. Le Plongeon’s papers
is one on “The Mayas, their customs,
laws, religion,” in the <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Aug.,
1887. Bancroft’s second volume groups the necessary
references to every phase of Maya history.
Cf. Charnay, English translation, ch. 15;
and Geronimo Castillo’s <i>Diccionario Histórico,
biográfico y monumental de Yucatan</i> (Mérida,
1866). Of Crescencio Carrillo and his <i>Historia
Antigua de Yucatan</i> (Mérida, 1881), Brinton
says: “I know of no other Yucatecan who has
equal enthusiasm or so just an estimate of the
antiquarian riches of his native land” (<i>Amer.
Hero Myths</i>, 147). Bastian summarizes the history
of Yucatan and Guatemala in the second
volume of his <i>Culturländer des alten Amerika</i>.</p>

Max Müller dissents from this. <i>Chips</i>, i.

the disjointed manner of what has come down

is altogether a modern idea, of which few
only of the ancient nations had any conception.
If we had the exact words of the <i>Popul Vuh</i>, we
should probably find no more history there than
we find in the Quiché MS. as it now stands.”</p>

Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i>, ii. 391) says
that it is now acknowledged that the <i>Recordacion
florida</i> of Fuentes y Guzman is “full of exaggerations
and misstatements.” Brasseur (<i>Bib.
Mex.-Guat.</i>, pp. 65, 87), in speaking of Fuentes’
<i>Noticia histórica de los indios de Guatemala</i> (of
which manuscript he had a copy), says that he
had access to a great number of native documents,
but profited little by them, either because
he could not read them, or his translators deceived
him. Brasseur adds that Fuentes’ account
of the Quiché rulers is “un mauvais roman qui
n’a pas le sens commun.” This last is a manuscript
used by Domingo Juarros in his <i>Compendio
de la historia de la ciudad de Guatemala</i>
(Guatemala, 1808-1818, in two vols.&mdash;become
rare), but reprinted in the <i>Museo Guatemalteco</i>,
1857. The English translation, by John Baily,
a merchant living in Guatemala, was published
as a <i>Statistical and Commercial History of Guatemala</i>
(Lond., 1823). Cf. Vol. II. p. 419. Francisco
Vazquez depended largely on native writers

A list of Squier’s published writings was appended
to the <i>Catalogue of Squier’s Library</i>,
prepared by Joseph Sabin (N. Y., 1876), as sold
at that time. By this it appears that his earliest
study of these subjects was a review of Buxton’s
<i>Migrations of the Ancient Mexicans</i>, read before
the London Ethnolog. Soc., and printed in 1848
in the <i>Edinb. New Philosoph. Mag.</i>, vol. xlvi.
His first considerable contribution was his <i>Travels
in Cent. America, particularly in Nicaragua,
with a description of its aboriginal monuments</i>
(London and N. Y., 1852-53). He supplemented
this by some popular papers in <i>Harper’s
Mag.</i>, 1854, 1855. (Cf. <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, iv. 65; <i>Putnam’s
Mag.</i>, xii. 549.) A year or two later he
communicated papers on “Les Indiens Guatusos
du Nicaragua,” and “Les indiens Xicaques
du Honduras,” to the <i>Nouvelles Annales des
Voyages</i> (1856, 1858), and “A Visit to the Guajiquero
Indians” to <i>Harper’s Mag.</i>, 1859. In
1860, Squier projected the publication of a <i>Collection</i>
of documents, but only a letter (1576) of
Palacio was printed (Icazbalceta, <i>Bibl. Mex.</i>, i.
p. 326). He had intended to make the series
more correct and with fewer omissions than Ternaux
had allowed himself. His material, then
the result of ten years’ gathering, had been
largely secured through the instrumentality of
Buckingham Smith. (See Vol. II. p. vii.)</p>

Discrediting Gomara’s statement that De Ayllon found
tribes near Cape Hatteras who had tame deer and made
cheese from their milk, Dr. Brinton says: “Throughout
the continent there is not a single authentic instance of a
pastoral tribe, not one of an animal raised for its milk, nor
for the transportation of persons, and very few for their
flesh. It was essentially a hunting race.” (<i>Myths of the
New World</i>, 21.) He adds: “The one mollifying element
was agriculture, substituting a sedentary for a wandering
life, supplying a fixed dependence for an uncertain contingency.”</p>

“No writer,” says Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> ii.
674), “has been more prolific in pictures of pomp, regal
wealth and magnificence, than Bernal Diaz. Most of the
later writers have placed undue reliance on his statements,
assuming that the truthfulness of his own individual feelings
was the result of cool observation. Any one who has read
attentively his <i>Mémoirs</i> will become convinced that he is
in fact one of the most unreliable eye-witnesses, so far as
general principles are concerned.... Cortes had personal
and political motives to magnify and embellish the picture.
If his statements fall far below those of his troopers in
thrilling and highly-colored details, there is every reason to
believe that they are the more trustworthy.... In the descriptions
by Cortes we find, on the whole, nothing but a
barbarous display common to other Indian celebrations of a
similar character.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bandelier’s further comment is (<i>Ibid.</i> ii. 397) “A feudal
empire at Tezcuco was an invention of the chroniclers, who
had a direct interest, or thought to have one, in advancing
the claims of the Tezcucan tribe to an original supremacy.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bandelier again (<i>Ibid.</i> ii. 385) points out the early statements
of the conquerors, and of their annalists, which have
prompted the inference of a feudal condition of society;
but he refers to Ixtlilxochitl as “the chief originator of the
feudal view;” and from him Torquemada draws his inspiration.
Wilson (<i>Prehist. Man</i>, i. 242) holds much the same
views.</p>

Bandelier (“Art of War, etc.,” in <i>Peabody Mus. Rept.</i>
x. 113) again says of De Pauw’s <i>Recherches philosophiques
sur les Américaines</i>, that it is “a very injudicious book,
which by its extravagance and audacity created a great deal
of harm. It permitted Clavigero to attack even Robertson,
because the latter had also applied sound criticism to the
study of American aboriginal history, and by artfully placing
both as upon the same platform, to counteract much of
the good effects of Robertson’s work.”</p>

In regard to the nature of the chief-of-men we find,
among much else of the first importance in the study of the
Mexican government, an exposition in Sahagún (lib. vi. cap.
20), which seems to establish the elective and non-hereditary
character of the office. It was “this office and its attributes,”
says Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> ii. 670),
“which have been the main stays of the notion that a high
degree of civilization prevailed in aboriginal Mexico, in so
far as its people were ruled after the manner of eastern despotisms.”
Bandelier (<i>Ibid.</i> ii. 133) says: “It is not impossible
that the so-called empire of Mexico may yet prove to
have been but a confederacy of the Nahuatlac tribe of the
valley, with the Mexicans as military leaders.” His argument
on the word translated “king” is not convincing.</p>

In the Appendix to his third volume, Prescott, relying

considers the evidences of immense populations; and respecting
some of their arts he adds, from inspection of specimens
of their handicraft, that “the Spanish conquerors
were not romancing in the wonderful stories they told of
the skill of the native goldsmiths.” On the other hand,
Morgan (<i>Houses and House Life</i>, 223) thinks the figures of

When we consider that Rome, Constantinople, and Jerusalem,
in spite of rapine, siege and fire, still retain numerous
traces of their earliest times, and that not a vestige of
the Aztec capital remains to us except its site, we must
assume, in Wilson’s opinion (<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. 331),
that its edifices and causeways must have been for the most
part more slight and fragile than the descriptions of the
conquerors implied. Morgan instances as a proof of the
flimsy character of their masonry, that Cortes in seventeen
days levelled three fourths of the city of Mexico. But, adds
Wilson, “so far as an indigenous American civilization is
concerned, no doubt can be entertained, and there is little
room for questioning, that among races who had carried civilization
so far, there existed the capacity for its further development,
independently of all borrowed aid” (p. 336).
The Baron Nordenskjöld informs me that there is in the
library at Upsala a MS. map of Mexico by Santa Cruz
(d. 1572) which contains numerous ethnographical details,

It was for Bandelier, in his “Social organization and
mode of government of the ancient Mexicans” (<i>Peabody
Mus. Repts.</i> ii. 557), to demonstrate the proposition that
tribal society based, according to Morgan, upon kin, and
not political society, which rests upon territory and property,
must be looked for among the ancient Mexicans.</p>

Bandelier’s papers are in the second volume of the <i>Reports
of the Peabody Museum</i> at Cambridge. He contends
in his “Art of Warfare among the Ancient Mexicans,” that
he has shown the non-existence of a military despotism,
and proved their government to be “a military democracy,
originally based upon communism in living.” A similar
understanding pervades his other essay “On the social organization
and mode of government of the ancient Mexicans.”
Morgan and Bandelier profess great admiration for
each other,&mdash;Morgan citing his friend as “our most eminent
scholar in Spanish American history” (<i>Houses</i>, etc.,
84), and Bandelier expresses his deep feeling of gratitude,
etc. (<i>Archæolog. Tour</i>, 32). This affectionate relation has
very likely done something in unifying their intellectual
sympathies. The <i>Ancient Society, or researches in the
lines of human progress from savagery through barbarism
to civilization</i> (N. Y. 1877), of Morgan is reflected very palpably
in these papers of Bandelier. The accounts of the
war of the conquest, as detailed in Bancroft’s <i>Mexico</i> (vol.
i.), and the views of their war customs (<i>Native Races</i>, ii.
ch. 13), contrasted with Bandelier’s ideas,&mdash;who finds in
Parkman’s books “the natural parallelism between the
forays of the Iroquois and the so-called conquests of the
Mexican confederacy” (<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 32), and who reduces
the battle of Otumba to an affair like that of Custer
and the Sioux (<i>Art of Warfare</i>),&mdash;give us in the military
aspects of the ancient life the opposed views of the two
schools of interpreters.</p>

Morgan in this, his last work, condenses in his first
chapter those which were numbered 1 to 4 in his <i>Ancient
Society</i>, and in succeeding sections he discusses the laws of
hospitality, communism, usages of land and food, and the
houses of the northern tribes, of those of New Mexico, San
Juan River, the moundbuilders, the Aztecs, and those in
Yucatan and Central America. Among these he finds three
distinct ethnical stages, as shown in the northern Indian,
higher in the sedentary tribes of New Mexico, and highest
among those of Mexico and Central America. S. F. Haven
commemorated Morgan’s death in the <i>Am. Antiq. Soc.
Proc.</i>, Apr., 1880.</p>

Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> ii. 391) points out that
when Martin Ursúa captured Tayasál on Lake Petin, the
last pueblo inhabited by Maya Indians, he found “all the
inhabitants living brutally together, an entire relationship
together in one single house,” and Bandelier refers further
to Morgan’s <i>Ancient Society</i>, Part 2, p. 181.</p>

Bandelier (<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> ii. 673) accepts the
views of Morgan, calling it “a rude clannish feast,” given
by the official household of the tribe as a part of its daily
duties and obligations.</p>

On the character of the Tecpan (council house, or official
house) of the Mexicans, which the early writers translate
“palace,” with its sense of magnificence, see Bandelier
(<i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> ii. 406, 671, etc.), with his references.
Morgan holds that Stephens is largely responsible
for the prevalence of erroneous notions regarding the
Mayas, by reason of using the words “palaces” and “great
cities” for defining what were really the pueblos of these
southern Indians. Bancroft (ii. 84), referring to the ruins,
says: They have “the highest value as confirming the truth
of the reports made by Spanish writers, very many, or perhaps
most, of whose statements respecting the wonderful
phenomena of the New World, without this incontrovertible
material proof, would find few believers among the
skeptical students of the present day.” Bancroft had little
prescience respecting what the communal theorists were
going to say of these ruins.</p>

Cf. Bancroft’s <i>Cent. America</i>, i. 317. Sir J. William
Dawson, in his <i>Fossil Men</i> (p. 83), contends that Morgan has
proved his point, and he calls the ruins of Spanish America
“communistic barracks” (p. 50). Higginson, in the first
chapter of his <i>Larger History</i>, which is a very excellent,
condensed popular statement of the new views which Morgan
inaugurated, says of him very truly, that he lacked moderation,
and that there is “something almost exasperating
in the positiveness with which he sometimes assumes as
proved that which is only probable.”</p>

John Lloyd Stephens, <i>Incidents of travel in Central
America, Chiapas, and Yucatan</i>, Lond. and N. Y. 1841,&mdash;various
later eds., that of London, 1854, being “revised
from the latest Amer. ed., with additions by Frederick
Catherwood.” Stephens started on this expedition in
1839, and he was armed with credentials from President
Van Buren. He travelled 3000 miles, and visited eight
ruined cities, as shown by his route given on the map in
vol. i. Cf. references in Allibone, ii. p. 2240; <i>Poole’s Index</i>,
p. 212; his <i>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</i> will be
mentioned later.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Frederick Catherwood’s <i>Views of Ancient Monuments
in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan</i> (Lond. 1844)
has a brief text (pp. 24) and 25 lithographed plates. Some
of the original drawings used in making these plates were
included in the <i>Squier Catalogue</i>, p. 229. (Sabin’s <i>Dict.</i>
iii. no. 11520.) Captain Lindesay Brine, in his paper on
the “Ruined Cities of Central America” (<i>Journal Roy.
Geog. Soc.</i> 1872, p. 354; <i>Proc.</i> xvii. 67), testifies to the
accuracy of Stephens and Catherwood. These new developments
furnished the material for numerous purveyors to
the popular mind, some of them of the slightest value, like
Asahel Davis, whose <i>Antiquities of Central America</i>,
with some slight changes of title, and with the parade of
new editions, were common enough between 1840 and
1850.</p>

The English translation is condensed in parts: <i>The
ancient cities of the New World: being travels and explorations
in Mexico and Central America from 1857-1882</i>.
<i>Translated from the French by J. Gonino and
Helen S. Conant.</i> (London, 1887.) Some of his notable
results were the discovery of stucco ornaments in the province
of Iturbide, among ruins which he unfortunately
named Lorillard City (Eng. tr. ch. 22). The palace at Tula
is also figured in Brocklehurst’s <i>Mexico to-day</i>, ch. 25. The
discovery of what Charnay calls glass and porcelain is
looked upon as doubtful by most archæologists, who believe
the specimens to be rather traces of Spanish contact.</p>

Bancroft (v. 200) gives references on these points, and
particular note may be taken of Veytia, i. 18, 155, 199; and
Brasseur, <i>Hist. Nations Civ.</i> iv. 182. Cf. also Nadaillac,
p. 351. Bandelier (<i>Archæolog. Tour</i>, 248, 249) favors the
gradual growth theory, and collates early sources (p. 250).
Bancroft (iv. 474) holds that we may feel very sure its erection
dates back of the tenth, and perhaps of the seventh,
century.</p>

Bandelier’s idea (p. 254) is that as the Indians never
repair a ruin, they abandoned this remaining mound after
its disaster, and transplanted the worship of Quetzalcoatl
to the new mound, since destroyed, while the old shrine
was in time given to the new cult of the Rain-god.</p>

It is illustrated with a map of the district of Cholula (p.
158), a detailed plan of the pyramid or mound (Humboldt
is responsible for the former term) as it stands amid roads
and fields (p. 230), and a fac-simile of an old map of the
pueblo of Cholula (1581).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bandelier speaks of the conservative tendencies of the
native population of this region, giving a report that old
native idols are still preserved and worshipped in caves, to
which he could not induce the Indians to conduct him (p.
156); and that when he went to see the <i>Mapa de Cuauhtlantzinco</i>,
or some native pictures of the 16th century, representing
the Conquest, and of the highest importance for
its history, he was jealously allowed but one glance at
them, and could not get another (<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, p. 123).
He adds: “The difficulty attending the consultation of
any documents in the hands of Indians is universal, and
results from their superstitious regard for writings on paper.
The bulk of the people watch with the utmost jealousy over
their old papers.... They have a fear lest the power vested
in an original may be transferred to a copy” (pp. 155-6).</p>

Bancroft (iv. 505, 516, with references) says that such
objects, when brought to light by excavations, have not
always been removed from their hiding-places; and he argues
that beneath the city there may yet be “thousands of
interesting monuments.” Cf. B. Mayer’s <i>Mexico as it
was</i>, vol. ii.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bandelier (<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, Part ii. p. 49) gives us
valuable “Archæological Notes about the City of Mexico,”
in which he says that Alfredo Chavero owns a very large
oil painting, said to have been executed in 1523, giving a
view of the aboriginal city and the principal events of the
Conquest. It shows that the ancient city was about one
quarter the size of the modern town.</p>
<p class="pfc4">We find descriptions of the city before the conquerors
transformed it, in Brasseur’s <i>Hist. Nations Civ.</i> iii. 187;
iv. line 13; and in Bancroft (ii. ch. 18) there is a collation
of authorities on Nahua buildings, with specific references
on the city of Mexico (ii. p. 567). Bandelier describes with
citations its military aspects at the time of the Conquest
(<i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>, x. 151).</p>

<p class="pfc4">Antonio de Leon y Gama, who unfortunately had no

Bancroft’s numerous references make a foot-note (iv.
530). He adds a plan from Almaraz, and says that the
description of Linares (<i>Soc. Mex. Geog. Boletin</i>, 30, i.
103) is mainly drawn from Almaraz. It is believed, but not
absolutely proven, that the mounds were natural ones, artificially
shaped (Bandelier, 44). The extent of the ruins is
very great, and it is a current belief that the city in its
prime must have been very large. The whole region is exceptionally
rich in fragmentary and small relics, like pottery,
obsidian implements, and terra-cotta heads. Cf. for
these last, <i>Lond. Geog. Soc. Journal</i>, vii. 10; Thompson’s
<i>Mexico</i>, 140; Nebel, <i>Viaje</i>; Mayer’s <i>Mexico as it was</i>,
227 (as cited in Bancroft, iv. 542); and later publications
like T. U. Brocklehurst’s <i>Mexico to-day</i> (Lond., 1883), and
Zelia Nuttall’s “Terra Cotta Heads from Teotihuacan,” in
the <i>Amer. Journal of Archæology</i> (June and Sept. 1886),
ii. 157, 318.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bancroft judges that the ruins date back to the sixth century,
and says that these mounds served for models of the
Aztec teocallis. On the commission already referred to
was Antonio García y Cubas, who conducted some personal
explorations, and in describing these in a separate publication,
<i>Ensayo de un Estudio Comparativo entre las Pirámides
Egípcias y Mexicanas</i> (Mexico, 1871), he points out
certain analogies of the American and Egyptian structures,
which will be found in epitome in Bancroft (iv. 543). In
discussing the monoliths of the ruins, Amos W. Butler
(<i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, May, 1885), in a paper on “The Sacrificial
Stone of San Juan Teotihuacan,” advanced some
views that are controverted by W. H. Holmes in the
<i>Amer. Journal of Archæology</i> (i. 361), from whose foot-notes
a good bibliography of the subject can be derived.
Bandelier (<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 42) thinks that because no specific
mention is made of them in Mexican tradition, it is
safe to infer that these monuments antedate the Mexicans,
and were in ruins at the time of the Conquest.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1022_1022" id="Footnote_1022_1022"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1022_1022"><span class="label">[1022]</span></a></span>
The early writers make little mention of the place except
as one of the halting-places of the Aztec migration.
Torquemada has something to say (quoted in <i>Soc. Mex.
Geog. Bol.</i>, 2º, iii. 278, with the earliest of the modern accounts
by Manuel Gutierrez, in 1805). Capt. G. F. Lyon
(<i>Journal of a residence and tour in Mexico</i>, London, 1828)
visited the ruins in 1828. Pedro Rivera in 1830 described
them in Márcos de Esparza’s <i>Informe presentado al Gobierno</i>
(Zacatecas, 1830,&mdash;also in <i>Museo Méxicano</i>, i. 185,
1843). The plan in Nebel’s Viaje (copied in Bancroft, iv.
582) was made for Governor García, by Berghes, a German
engineer, in 1831, who at the time was accompanied by J.
Burkart (<i>Aufenthalt und Reisen in Mexico</i>, Stuttgart, 1836),
who gives a plan of fewer details. Bancroft (iv. 579) thinks
Nebel’s views of the ruins the only ones ever published,
and he enumerates various second-hand writers (iv. 579).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cf. Fegeux, “Les ruines de la Quemada,” in the <i>Revue
d’Ethnologie</i>, i. 119. The noticeable features of these ruins
are their massiveness and height of walls, their absence
of decoration and carved idols, and the lack of pottery and
the smaller relics. Their history, notwithstanding much
search, is a blank.</p>

Cf. Short, p. 396. Le Plongeon retorts (<i>Amer. Antiq.
Soc. Proc.</i>, n. s., i. 282) by telling his critic that he had
never been in Yucatan. Considering the effect of contact in
many of those who have written of the ruins, it may be a
question if the implication is valuable as a piece of criticism.
Mr. Salisbury and Dr. Le Plongeon reported from time to
time in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i> the results of the
latter’s investigations, and the researches to which they
gave rise. Those in April, 1876, and April, 1877, of these
<i>Proceedings</i>, were privately printed by Mr. Salisbury, as
<i>The Mayas</i>, etc. In April, 1878, Mr. Salisbury reported
upon the “Terra-cotta figures from Isla Mujeres.” In Oct.,
1878, there were communications from Dr. Le Plongeon,
and from Alice D. Le Plongeon, his wife. In April, 1879,
Dr. Le Plongeon communicated a letter on the affinities of
Central America and the East. Since this the Le Plongeons
have found other channels of communication. Dr.
Le Plongeon expanded his somewhat extravagant notions
of Oriental affinities in his <i>Sacred mysteries among the
Mayas and the Quiches, 11,500 years ago; their relation
to the sacred mysteries of Egypt, Greece, Chaldea, and
India. Freemasonry in times anterior to the temple of
Solomon</i> (New York, 1886).</p>
<p class="pfc4">His preface is largely made up with a rehearsal of his
rebuffs and in complaints of the want of public appreciation
of his labors. He is, however, as confident as ever, and
deciphers the bas-reliefs and mural inscriptions of Chichen-Itza
by “the ancient hieratic Maya alphabet” which he
claims to have discovered, and shows this alphabet in parallel
columns with that of Egypt as displayed by Champollion
and Bunsen. Mrs. Le Plongeon published her
<i>Vestiges of the Mayas</i> in New York, in 1881, and gathered
some of her periodical writings in her <i>Here and There
in Yucatan</i> (N. Y., 1886). Cf. her letter on the ancient
records of Yucatan in <i>The Nation</i>, xxix. 224.</p>

Baldwin (p. 125), in a condensed way, and likewise
Short (ch. 8) and Bancroft (iv. ch. 5), more at length, have
mainly depended on Stephens. Cf. references in Bancroft,
iv. 147, and Bandelier’s list in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc.
Proc.</i>, n. s., i. 82, 95. E. H. Thompson has contributed papers
in <i>Ibid.</i> Oct., 1886, p. 248, and April, 1887, p. 379,
and on the ruins of Kich-Moo and Chun-Kal-Cin in April,
1888, p. 162. Brasseur, beside his <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, ii.
20, has something in his introduction to his <i>Relation de
Landa</i>. The description of the ruins at Zayi, which Stephens
gives, shows that some of the rooms were filled solid with
masonry, and he leaves it as an unaccountable fact; but
Morgan (<i>Houses and House Life</i>, p. 267) thinks it shows
that the builders constructed a core of masonry, over which
they reared the walls and ceilings, which last, after hardening,
were able to support themselves, when the cores were
removed; and that in the ruins at Zayi we see the cores
unremoved.</p>

Cf. the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> in Waldeck and Charnay. Waldeck
first named the ornaments as “Elephants’ trunks”
(<i>Voy. Pitt.</i> p. 74). There are cuts in Stephens, reproduced
in Bancroft. There is also a cut in Norman. Cf. E. H.
Thompson in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1887, p. 382.</p>

Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, ii. 265, gives an ancient Indian
map (1557), and extracts from the archives of Mani, which
lead him to infer that at that time it was an inhabited Indian
town.</p>

Bancroft (iv. 151) gives various references to second-hand
descriptions, noted before 1875, to which may be
added those in Short, p. 347; Nadaillac, 334; Amer. Antiquarian,
vii. 257, and again, July, 1888.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Probably the most accurate of the plans of the ruins is
that of Stephens (<i>Yucatan</i>, i. 165), which is followed by
Bancroft (iv. 153). Brasseur’s report has a plan, and others,
all differing, are given by Waldeck (pl. viii.), Norman (p.
155), and Charnay (<i>Ruines</i>, p. 62). Views and cuts of details
are found in Waldeck, Stephens, Charnay,&mdash;whence
later summarizers like Bancroft, Baldwin, and Short have
drawn their copies; while special cuts are copied in Armin
(<i>Das Heutige Mexico</i>); Larenaudière (<i>Mexique et Guatemala</i>,
Paris, 1847); Le Plongeon (<i>Sacred Mysteries</i>);
Ruge (<i>Zeitalter der Entdeckungen</i>, p. 357); Morgan
(<i>Houses</i>, etc., ch. xi.), and in various others. One can best
trace the varieties and contrasts of the different accounts
of the various edifices in Bancroft’s collations of their
statements. His constant citation, even to scorn them, of
the impertinencies of George Jones’s <i>Hist. of Anc. America</i>
(London, 1842),&mdash;the later notorious Count Johannes,&mdash;was
hardly worth while.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1046_1046" id="Footnote_1046_1046"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1046_1046"><span class="label">[1046]</span></a></span>

All other accounts are based on these. Bancroft, who
gives the best summary (iv. 221), enumerates many of the
second-hand writers, to whom Short (p. 396) must be added.
Stephens gives a plan (ii. 290) which Bancroft (iv. 222) follows;
and it apparently is worthy of reasonable confidence,
which cannot be said of Norman’s. The ruins present
some features not found in others, and the most interesting
of such may be considered the wall paintings, one representing
a boat with occupants, which Stephens found on
the walls of the building called by him the Gymnasium, because
of stone rings projecting from the walls (see annexed
cut), which were supposed by him to have been used in
ball games. Norman calls the same building the Temple;
Charnay, the Cirque; but the native designation is Iglesia.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1048_1048" id="Footnote_1048_1048"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1048_1048"><span class="label">[1048]</span></a></span>

Bancroft collates the views of different writers (iv. 285).
He himself holds that these buildings are more ancient
than those of Anáhuac; consequently he rejects the arguments
of Stephens, that it was by the Toltecs, after they migrated
south from Anáhuac, that these constructions were
raised (<i>Native Races</i>, v. 165, and for references, p. 169).
Charnay (<i>Bull. de la Soc. de Géog.</i>, Nov., 1881) believes
they were erected between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is well known now that the concentric rings are a useless
guide in tropical regions to determine the age of trees,
though in the past, the immense size of trees as well as the
deposition of soil have been used to determine the supposed
ages of ruins. Waldeck counted a ring a year in getting
two thousand years for the time since the abandonment of
Palenqué; but Charnay (Eng. tr. <i>Ancient Cities</i>, p. 260)
says that these rings are often formed monthly. Cf. Nadaillac,
p. 323.</p>

So called because near a modern village of that name,
founded by the Spaniards about 1564. Bancroft (iv. 296)
says the ruins are ordinarily called by the natives Casas de
Piedra. Ordoñez calls them Nachan, but without giving
any authority, and some adopt the Aztec equivalent Calhuacan,
city of the serpents. Because Xibalba is held by
some to be the name of the great city of this region in the
shadowy days of Votan, that name has also been applied to
the ruins. Otolum, or the ruined place, is a common designation
thereabouts, but Palenqué is the appellation in use
by most travellers and writers.</p>

The fact is, that widely distinct estimates have been
held, some dating them back into the remotest antiquity,
and others making them later than the Conquest. Bancroft
(iv. 362) collates these statements. Cf. Dr. Earl Flint in
<i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, iv. 289. Morelet identifies them with
the Toltec remains, supposing them to be the work of that
people after their emigration, and to be of about the same
age as Mitla. Charnay (<i>Anc. Cities of the New World</i>, p.
260) claims that Cortes knew the place as the religious metropolis
of the Acaltecs. On the question of Cortes’ knowledge
see <i>Science</i>, Feb. 27, 1885, p. 171; and <i>Ibid.</i> (by Brinton)
March 27, 1885, p. 248.</p>

Field, no. 231; Sabin, xvii. p. 292. The report of Rio
was brief, and as we would judge now, superficial. Dupaix
treats him disparagingly. The appended essay by Cabrera,
an Italian, is said to have been largely filched from Ramon’s
paper, which had been confidentially placed in his hands
(Short, 207). A Spanish text of Cabrera is in the Museo
Nacional. Cf. Brasseur (<i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>), p. 30; Pinart,
no. 186. It is a question if the plates, which constituted the
most interesting part of the English book, be Rio’s after
all; for though they profess to be engraved after his drawings,
they are suspiciously like those made by Castañeda,
twenty years after Rio’s visit (Bancroft, iv. 290). David
B. Warden translated Rio’s report in the <i>Recueil de voyages
et de Mémoires, par la Soc. de in Géog. de Paris</i>.
(vol. ii.), and gave some of the plates. (Cf. Warden’s <i>Recherches
sur les antiquités de l’Amérique Septentrionale</i>,
Paris, 1827, in <i>Mém. de la Soc. de Géog.</i>) There is a German
version, <i>Beschreibung einer alten Stadt</i> (Berlin, 1832),

Particularly ch. 13, 14. Charnay is the last of the explorers
of Palenqué. All the other accounts of the ruins
found here and there are based on the descriptions of
those who have been named, or at least nothing is added
of material value by other actual visitors like Norman
(<i>Rambles in Yucatan</i>, p. 284). Bancroft (iv. 294) enumerates
a number of such second-hand describers. The most
important work since Bancroft’s summary is Manuel Larrainzar’s
<i>Estudios sobre la historia de America, sus ruinas
y antigüedades, y sobre el orígen de sus habitantes</i> (Mexico,
1875-78), in five vols., all of whose plates are illustrations
from the ruins of Palenqué, which are described and compared
with other ancient remains throughout the world.
Cf. Brühl, <i>Culturvölker d. alt. Amerikas</i>. Plans of the
ruins will be found in Waldeck (pl. vii., followed mainly
by Bancroft, iv. 298, 307), Stephens (ii. 310), Dupaix (pl.
xi.), Kingsborough (iv. pl. 13), and Charnay (ch. 13 and
14). The views of the ruins given by these authorities
mainly make up the stock of cuts in all the popular narratives.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The most interesting of the carvings is what is known as
the Tablet of the Cross, which was taken from one of the
minor buildings, and is now in the National Museum at
Washington. It has often been engraved, but such representations
never satisfied the student till they could be
tested by the best of Charnay’s photographs. (Engravings
in Brasseur and Waldeck, pl. 21, 22; Rosny’s <i>Essai sur
le déchiffrement</i>, etc.; Minutoli’s <i>Beschreibung einer alten
Stadt in Guatimala</i> (Berlin, 1832); Stephens’s <i>Cent.
Amer.</i>, ii.; Bancroft, <i>Nat. Races</i>, iv. 333; Charnay, <i>Les

<i>Powell’ s Rept.</i>, i. 221; cf. p. 234; <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, vii.
200.) The most important discussion of the tablet is
Charles Rau’s <i>Palenqué Tablet in the U. S. National
Museum</i> (Washington, 1879), being the <i>Smithsonian Contri.
to Knowledge</i>, no. 331, or vol. xxii. It contains an account
of the explorations that have been made at Palenqué, and
a chapter on the “Aboriginal writing in Mexico, Central
America, and Yucatan, with some account of the attempted
translations of Maya hieroglyphics.” Rau’s conclusion is
that it is a Phallic symbol. Cf. a summary in <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>,
vi., Jan., 1884, and in <i>Amer. Art Review</i>, 1880,
p. 217. Rau’s paper was translated into Spanish and
French: <i>Tablero del Palenque en el Museo nacional de los
Estados-Unidos</i> [traducido por Joaquin Davis y Miguel
Perez], in the <i>Anales del Museo nacional</i>. Tomo 2, pp.
131-203. (México, 1880.) <i>La Stèle de Palenqué du Musée
national des Etats-Unis, à Washington. Traduit de
l’Anglais avec autorisation de l’auteur.</i> In the <i>Annales
du Musée Guimet</i>, vol. x. (Paris, 1887.) Rau’s views were
criticised by Morgan.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are papers by Charency on the interpretation of the
hieroglyphs in <i>Le Muséon</i> (Paris, 1882, 1883).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The significance of the cross among the Nahuas and
Mayas has been the subject of much controversy, some connecting
it with a possible early association with Christians in
ante-Columbian days (Bancroft, iii. 468). On this later point
see Bamps, <i>Les traditions relatives à l’homme blanc et au
signe de la cruz en Amérique à l’Epoque précolumbienne</i>,
in the <i>Compte rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i> (Copenhagen,
1883), p. 125; and “Supposed vestiges of early
Christian teaching in America,” in the <i>Catholic Historical
Researches</i> (vol. i., Oct., 1885). The symbolism is variously
conceived. Bandelier (<i>Archæol. Jour.</i>) holds it to
be the emblem of fire, indeed an ornamented fire-drill,
which later got mixed up with the Spanish crucifix. Brinton
(<i>Myths of the New World</i>, 95) sees in it the four cardinal
points, the rain-bringers, the symbol of life and health,
and cites (p. 96) various of the early writers in proof. Brinton
(<i>Am. Hero Myths</i>, 155) claims to have been the first
to connect the Palenqué cross with the four cardinal points.
The bird and serpent&mdash;the last shown better in Charnay’s
photograph than in Stephens’s cut&mdash;is (<i>Myths</i>, 119) simply
a rebus of the air-god, the ruler of the winds. Brinton
says that Waldeck, in a paper on the tablet in the <i>Revue
Américaine</i> (ii. 69), came to a similar conclusion. Squier
(<i>Nicaragua</i>, ii. 337) speaks of the common error of mistaking
the tree of life of the Mexicans for the Christian
symbol. Cf. Powell’s <i>Second Rept., Bur. of Ethnol.</i>, p.
208; the <i>Fourth Rept.</i>, p. 252, where discredit is thrown
upon Gabriel de Mortillet’s <i>Le Signe de la cross avant le
Christianisme</i> (Paris, 1866); Joly’s <i>Man before Metals</i>,
339; and Charnay’s <i>Les Anciens Villes</i> (or Eng. transl. p.
85). Cf. for various applications the references in Bancroft’s
index (v. p. 671).</p>

Both were alike, and one was broken in two. There
are engravings in Waldeck, pl. 25; Stephens, ii. 344, 349;

These have been the subject of an elaborate folio,
thought, however, to be of questionable value, <i>Die Steinbildwerke

English translation, <i>The stone sculptures of Copán and
Quiriguá</i>; translated from the German by <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Savage
(New York, 1883). It gives twenty plates, Catherwood’s
plates, and the cuts in Stephens, with reproductions in accessible
books (Bancroft, iv. ch. 3; Powell’s <i>First Rept.
Bur. Ethn.</i> 224; Ruge’s <i>Gesch. des Zeitalters; Amer. Antiquarian</i>,

Squier says: “There are various reasons for believing
that both Copan and Quirigua antedate Olosingo and Palenqué,
precisely as the latter antedate the ruins of Quiché,
Chichen-Itza, and Uxmal, and that all of them were the
work of the same people, or of nations of the same race,
dating from a high antiquity, and in blood and language
precisely the same that was found in occupation of the country
by the Spaniards.”</p>

<i>Central America</i>, i. ch. 5-7; <i>Views of Anc. Mts.</i> It
is Stephens’s account which has furnished the basis of those
given by Bancroft (iv. ch. 3); Baldwin, p. 111; Short, 356;
Nadaillac, 328, and all others. Bancroft in his bibliog.
note (iv. pp. 79-81), which has been collated with my own
notes, mentions others of less importance, particularly the
report of Center and Hardcastle to the Amer. Ethnol. Soc.
in 1860 and 1862, and the photographs made by Ellerley,
which Brasseur (<i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i> i. 96; ii. 493; <i>Palenqué</i>,
8, 17) found to confirm the drawings and descriptions of
Catherwood and Stephens.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Stephens (<i>Cent. Am.</i>, i. 133) made a plan of the ruins reproduced
in <i>Annales des Voyages</i> (1841, p. 57), which is
the basis of that given by Bancroft (iv. 85). Dr. Julius
Schmidt, who was a member of the Squier expedition in
1852-53, furnished the historical and descriptive text to a
work which in the English translation by <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Savage
is known as <i>Stone Sculptures of Copán and Quiriguá,
drawn by Heinrich Meye</i> (N. Y., 1883). What Stephens
calls the Copan idols and altars are considered by Morgan
(<i>Houses and House Life</i>, 257), following the analogy of the
customs of the northern Indians, to be the grave-posts and
graves of Copan chiefs. Bancroft (iv. ch. 3) covers the
other ruins of Honduras and San Salvador; and Squier has
a paper on those of Tenampua in the <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, 1853.</p>

Other travellers who have visited them are John Baily,
<i>Central America</i> (Lond. 1850); A. P. Maudsley, <i>Explorations
in Guatemala</i> (Lond. 1883), with map and plans
of ruins, in the <i>Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc.</i> p. 185; W. T. Brigham’s
<i>Guatemala</i> (N. Y., 1886). Bancroft (iv. 109) epitomizes
the existing knowledge; but the remains seem to be
less known than any other of the considerable ruins. There
are a few later papers: G. Williams on the Antiquities of
Guatemala, in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1876; Simeon Habel’s

Bancroft (<i>Nat. Races</i>, ii. ch. 24) translates these from
Landa, Peter Martyr, Cogulludo, Villagutierre, Mendieta,
Acosta, Benzoni, and Herrera, and thinks all the modern
writers (whom he names, p. 770) have drawn from these
earlier ones, except, perhaps, Medel in <i>Nouv. Annales des
Voyages</i>, xcvii. 49. Cf. Wilson, <i>Prehistoric Man</i>, ii. 61.
It will be seen later that Holden discredits the belief in any
phonetic value of the Maya system. But compare on the
phonetic value of the Mexican and Maya systems, Brinton
in <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i> (Nov. 1886); Lazarus Geiger’s
<i>Contrib. to the Hist. of the Development of the Human
Race</i> (Eng. tr. by David Asher). London, 1880, p. 75;

Dr. Bernoulli, who died at San Francisco, in California,
in 1878, and whose labors are commemorated in a notice
in the <i>Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft</i>
(vi. 710) at Basle, found at Tikal, in Guatemala, some
fragments of sculptured panels of wood, bearing hieroglyphics
as well as designs, which he succeeded in purchasing,
and they were finally deposited in 1879 in the Ethnological
Museum in Basle, where Rosny saw them, and describes
them, with excellent photographic representations,
in his <i>Doc. Ecrits de l’Antiq. Amér.</i> (p. 97). These tablets
are the latest additions to be made to the store already possessed
from Palenqué, as given by Stephens in his <i>Central
America, Chiapas, and Yucatan</i>; those of the Temple of
the Cross at Palenqué, after Waldeck’s drawings in the
<i>Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France</i> (ii., 1864); that
from Kabah in Yucatan, given by Rosny in his <i>Archives
Paléographiques</i> (i. p. 178; Atlas, pl. xx.), and one from
Chichen-Itza, figured by Le Plongeon in <i>L’Illustration</i>,
Feb. 10, 1882; not to name other engravings. Rosny holds
that Rau’s <i>Palenqué Tablet</i> (Washington, 1879) gives the
first really serviceably accurate reproduction of that inscription.
Cf. on Maya inscriptions, Bancroft, ii. 775; iv.
91, 97, 234; Morelet’s <i>Travels</i>; and Le Plongeon in <i>Am.
Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, n. s., i. 246. This last writer has been
thought to let his enthusiasm&mdash;not to say dogmatism&mdash;turn
his head, under which imputation he is not content,

“Landa’s alphabet a Spanish fabrication,” appeared
in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1880. In this, Philipp
J. J. Valentini interprets all that the old writers say of
the ancient writings to mean that they were pictorial and not
phonetic; and that Landa’s purpose was to devise a vehicle
which seemed familiar to the natives, through which he
could communicate religious instruction. His views have
been controverted by Léon de Rosny (<i>Doc. Ecrits de la
Antiq. Amér.</i> p. 91); and Brinton (<i>Maya Chronicles</i>, 61),
calls them an entire misconception of Landa’s purpose.</p>

<i>Manuscrit Troano Etudes sur le système graphique et
la langue des Mayas</i> (Paris, 1869-70)&mdash;the first volume
containing a fac-simile of the Codex in seventy plates,
with Brasseur’s explications and partial interpretation.
In the second volume there is a translation of Gabriél de
Saint Bonaventure’s <i>Grammaire Maya</i>, a “Chrestomathie”
of Maya extracts, and a Maya lexicon of more than
10,000 words. Brasseur published at the same time (1869)
in the <i>Mémoires de la Soc. d’Ethnographie a Lettre à M.
Léon de Rosny sur la découverte de documents relatifs à la
haute antiquité américaine, et sur le déchiffrement et l’interprétation
de l’écriture phonétique et figurative de la
langue Maya</i> (Paris, 1869). He explained his application
of Landa’s alphabet in the introduction to the <i>MS. Troano</i>,
i. p. 36. Brasseur later confessed he had begun at the
wrong end of the MS. (<i>Bib. Mex.-Guat.</i>, introd.). The
pebble-shape form of the characters induced Brasseur to call
them <i>calculiform</i>; and Julien Duchateau adopted the
term in his paper “Sur l’écriture calculiforme des Mayas”
in the <i>Annuaire de la Soc. Amér.</i> (Paris, 1874), iii. p. 31.</p>

It is the development of a paper given at the Nancy
session of the Congrès des Américanistes (1875). Landa’s
alphabet with the variations make 262 of the 700 signs
which Rosny catalogues. He printed his “Nouvelles Recherches
pour l’interpretation des caractères de l’Amérique
Centrale” in the <i>Archives</i>, etc., iii. 118. There is a paper on
Rosny’s studies by De la Rada in the Compte-rendu of the
Copenhagen session (p. 355) of the Congrès des Américanistes.
Rosny’s <i>Documents écrits de l’antiquité Américaine</i>
(Paris, 1882), from the <i>Mémoires de la Société d’Ethnographie</i>
(1881), covers his researches in Spain and Portugal
for material illustrative of the pre-Columbian history of
America. Cf. also his “Les sources de l’histoire anté
columbienne du nouveau monde,” in the <i>Mémoires de la

Cf. Short, p. 425. Dr. Harrison Allen in 1875, in the
<i>Amer. Philosophical Society’s Transactions</i>, made an analysis
of Landa’s alphabet and the published codices. Rau,
in his <i>Palenqué Tablet of the U. S. Nat. Museum</i> (ch. 5),
examines what had been done up to 1879. In the same
year Dr. Carl Schultz-Sellack wrote on “Die Amerikanischen
Götter der vier Weltgegenden und ihre Tempel in
Palenqué,” touching also the question of interpretation (<i>Zeitschrift
für Ethnologie</i>, vol. xi.); and in 1880 Dr. Förstemann
examined the matter in his introduction to his reproduction
of the Dresden Codex.</p>

<i>Studies in Central American picture-writing</i> (Washington,
1881), extracted from the <i>First Report of the Bureau
of Ethnology</i>. His method is epitomized in <i>The Century</i>,
Dec., 1881. He finds Stephens’s drawings the most
trustworthy of all, Waldeck’s being beautiful, but they embody
“singular liberties.” His examination was confined
to the 1500 separate hieroglyphs in Stephens’s <i>Central
America</i>. Some of Holden’s conclusions are worth noting:
“The Maya manuscripts do not possess to me the
same interest as the stones, and I think it may be certainly
said that all of them are younger than the Palenqué tablets,
far younger than the inscriptions at Copan.” “I distrust
the methods of Brasseur and others who start from
the misleading and unlucky alphabet handed down by
Landa,” by forming variants, which are made “to satisfy
the necessities of the interpreter in carrying out some preconceived
idea.” He finds a rigid adherence to the standard
form of a character prevailing throughout the same inscription.
At Palenqué the inscriptions read as an English
inscription would read, beginning at the left and proceeding
line by line downward. “The system employed at Palenqué
and Copan was the same in its general character,
and almost identical even in details.” He deciphers three
proper names: “all of them have been pure picture-writing,
except in so far as their rebus character may make
them in a sense phonetic.” Referring to Valentini’s
<i>Landa Alphabet a Spanish Fabrication</i>, he agrees in that
critic’s conclusions. “While my own,” he adds, “were
reached by a study of the stones and in the course of a
general examination, Dr. Valentini has addressed himself
successfully to the solution of a special problem.” Holden
thinks his own solution of the three proper names points
of departure for subsequent decipherers. The Maya method
was “pure picture-writing. At Copan this is found in
its earliest state; at Palenqué it was already highly conventionalized.”</p>

also printed separately (fifty copies) under the title of <i>De
la destruction de antigüedades méxicanas atribuida á los
misioneros en general, y particularmente al Illmo. Sr. D.
Fr. Juan de Zumárraga, primer Obispo y Arzobispo de
México</i> (Mexico, 1881). In this he exhausts pretty much
all that has been said on the subject by the bishop himself,
by Pedro de Gante, Motolinía, Sahagún, Duran, Acosta,
Davila Padilla, Herrera, Torquemada, Ixtlilxochitl, Robertson,
Clavigero, Humboldt, Bustamante, Ternaux, Prescott,
Alaman, etc. Brasseur (<i>Nat. Civil.</i>, ii. 4) says of Landa
that we must not forget that he was oftener the agent of
the council for the Indies than of the Church. Helps (iii.
374) is inclined to be charitable towards a man in a skeptical
age, so intensely believing as Zumárraga was.
Sahagún relates that earlier than Zumárraga, the fourth
ruler of his race, Itzcohuatl, had caused a large destruction
of native writings, in order to remove souvenirs of the national
humiliation.</p>

There is a wild variety in Mexico, the size
of a nut, and attempts have been made to increase
its size under cultivation during many
years, without any result. This seems to show
that a great length of time must have elapsed
before the ancient Peruvians could have brought
the cultivation of the potato to such a high state
of perfection as they undoubtedly did.</p>

Some years ago a priest named Cabrera, the
cura of a village called Macusani, in the province
of Caravaya, succeeded in breeding a cross between
the wild vicuña and the tame alpaca. He
had a flock of these beautiful animals, which
yielded long, silken, white wool; but they required
extreme care, and died out when the sustaining
hand of Cabrera was no longer available.
There is also a cross between a llama and an
alpaca, called <i>guariso</i>, as large as the llama, but
with much more wool. The guanaco and llama
have also been known to form a cross; but there
is no instance of a cross between the two wild
varieties,&mdash;the guanaco and vicuña. The extremely
artificial life of the alpaca, which renders
that curious and valuable animal so absolutely
dependent on the ministrations of its human
master, and the complete domestication of the
llama, certainly indicate the lapse of many centuries
before such a change could have been
effected.</p>

The name of the place where these remains

The names of this god were <i>Con-Illa-Tici-Uira-cocha</i>,
and he was the <i>Pachayachachic</i>, or
Teacher of the World. <i>Pacha</i> is “time,” or
“place;” also “the universe.” “<i>Yachachic</i>,” a
teacher, from “<i>Yachachini</i>,” “I teach.” <i>Con</i> is
said to signify the creating Deity (<i>Betanzos, Garcia</i>).
According to Gomara, Con was a creative
deity who came from the north, afterwards expelled
by Pachacamac, and a modern authority
(Lopez, p. 235) suggests that <i>Con</i> represented
the “cult of the setting sun,” because <i>Cunti</i>
means the west. <i>Tici</i> means a founder or foundation,
and <i>Illa</i> is light, from <i>Illani</i>, “I shine:”
“The Origin of Light” (<i>Montesinos. Anonymous
Jesuit.</i> Lopez suggests “<i>Ati</i>,” an evil omen,&mdash;the
Moon God); or, according to one authority,
“Light Eternal” (<i>The anonymous Jesuit</i>).
<i>Vira</i> is a corruption of <i>Pirua</i>, which is said by
some authorities to be the name of the first settler,
or the founder of a dynasty; and by others
to mean a “depository,” a “place of abode;”
hence a “dweller,” or “abider.” <i>Cocha</i> means
“ocean,” “abyss,” “profundity,” “space.” <i>Uira-cocha</i>,
“the Dweller in Space.” So that the
whole would signify “God: the Creator of
Light:” “the Dweller in Space: the Teacher
of the World.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Some authors gave the meaning of <i>Uira-cocha</i>
to be “foam of the sea:” from <i>Uira</i> (<i>Huira</i>),
“grease,” or “foam,” and <i>Cocha</i>, “ocean,”
“sea,” “lake.” Garcilasso de la Vega pointed
out the error. In compound words of a nominative
and genitive, the genitive is invariably
placed first in Quichua; so that the meaning
would be “a sea of grease,” not “grease of the
sea.” Hence he concludes that <i>Uira-cocha</i> is not
a compound word, but simply a name, the derivation
of which he does not attempt to explain.
Blas Valera says that it means “the will and
power of God;” not that this is the signification
of the word, but that such were the godlike attributes
of the being who was known by it. Acosta
says that to <i>Ticsi Uira-cocha</i> they assigned the
chief power and command over all things. The
anonymous Jesuit tells us that <i>Illa Ticsi</i> was the
original name, and that <i>Uira-cocha</i> was added
later.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of these names, <i>Illa Ticci</i> appears to have been
the most ancient.</p>

England. But twelve generations, allowing
twenty-five years for each, would only occupy
300 years.</p>

It is related by Betanzos that one day this
Inca appeared before his people with a very joyful
countenance. When they asked him the
cause of his joy, he replied that Uira-cocha Pachayachachic
had spoken to him in a dream that
night. Then all the people rose up and saluted
him as Viracocha Inca, which is as much as to
say,&mdash;“King and God.” From that time he was
so called. Garcilasso gives a different version
of the same tradition, in which he confuses Viracocha
with his son.</p>

The meanings of the names of these Incas
are significant. Manco and Rocca appear to be
proper names without any clear etymology. The
rest refer to mental attributes, or else to some
personal peculiarity. Sinchi means “strong.”
Lloque is “left-handed.” Yupanqui is the second
person of the future tense of a verb, and
signifies “you will count.” Garcilasso interprets
it as one who will count as wise, virtuous, and
powerful. Ccapac is rich; that is, rich in all
virtues and attributes of a prince. Mayta is an
adverb, “where;” and Salcamayhua says that
the constant cry and prayer of this Inca was,
“Where art thou, O God?” because he was
constantly seeking his Creator. Yahuar-huaccac
means “weeping blood,” probably in allusion
to some malady from which he suffered. Pachacutec
has already been explained. Tupac is
a word signifying royal splendor, and Huayna
means “youth.” Huascar is “a chain,” in allusion
to a golden chain said to have been made
in his honor, and held by the dancers at the festival
of his birth. The meaning of Atahualpa
has been much disputed. <i>Hualpa</i> certainly
means any large game fowl. <i>Hualpani</i> is to
create. <i>Atau</i> is “chance,” or “the fortune of
war.” Garcilasso, who is always opposed to derivations,
maintains that Atahualpa was a proper
name without special meaning, and that Hualpa,
as a word for a fowl, is derived from it, because
the boys in the streets, when imitating cock-crowing,
used the word Atahualpa. But Hualpa
formed part of the name of many scions
of the Inca family long before the time of Atahualpa.</p>

All authorities agree that Manco Ccapac
was the first Inca, although Montesinos places
him far back at the head of the Pirhua dynasty,
and all agree respecting the second, Sinchi
Rocca. Lloque Yupanqui, with various spellings,
has the unanimous vote of all authorities
except Acosta, who calls him “Iaguarhuarque.”
But Acosta’s list is incomplete. Respecting
Mayta Ccapac and Ccapac Yupanqui, all are
agreed except Betanzos, who transposes them
by an evident slip of memory. Touching Inca
Rocca all are agreed, though Montesinos has
Sinchi for Inca, and all agree as to Yahuar-huaccac.
It is true that Cieza de Leon and Herrera
call him Inca Yupanqui, but this is explained
by Salcamayhua when he gives the full name,&mdash;Yahuar-huaccac
Inca Yupanqui. All agree as
to Uira-cocha. As to his successor, Betanzos,
Cieza de Leon, Fernandez, Herrera, Salcamayhua,
and Balboa mention the short reign of the
deposed Urco. Cieza de Leon and Betanzos give
Yupanqui as the name of Urco’s brother; all
other authorities have Pachacutec. The discrepancy
is explained by his names having been
Yupanqui Pachacutec. This also accounts for
Garcilasso de la Vega and Santillan having
made Pachacutec and Yupanqui into two Incas,
father and son. Betanzos also interpolates a
Yamque Yupanqui. All are agreed with regard
to Tupac Inca Yupanqui, Huayna Ccapac, Huascar,
and Atahualpa. [There is another comparison

Mentioned by Calancha (471) and Arriaga
as an oracle at the village of Tauca, in Conchucos.
Brinton has built up a myth which he credits
to the whole Peruvian people, on the strength
of a meaning applied to the word <i>Catequilla</i>,
which is erroneous. It is exactly the same grammatical
error that those etymologists fell into
who thought that <i>Uira-cocha</i> signified “foam of

The sacrifices were called <i>runa</i>, <i>yuyac</i>, and
<i>huahua</i>. The Spaniards thought that <i>runa</i> and
<i>yuyac</i> signified men, and <i>huahua</i> children. This
was not the case when speaking of sacrificial
victims. <i>Runa</i> was applied to a male sacrifice,
<i>huahua</i> to the lambs, and <i>yuyac</i> signified an
adult or full-grown animal. The sacrificial animals
were also called after the names of those
who offered them, which was another cause of
erroneous assumptions by Spanish writers.
There was a law strictly prohibiting human sacrifices
among the conquered tribes; and the
statement that servants were sacrificed at the
obsequies of their masters is disproved by the
fact, mentioned by the anonymous Jesuit, that
in none of the burial-places opened by the Spaniards
in search of treasure were any human
bones found, except those of the buried lord
himself.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1190_1190" id="Footnote_1190_1190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1190_1190"><span class="label">[1190]</span></a></span>
Prescott (I. p. 98, note) accepted the statement
that human sacrifices were offered by the
Incas, because six authorities, Sarmiento, Cieza
de Leon, Montesinos, Balboa, Ondegardo, and
Acosta&mdash;outnumbered the single authority on
the other side, Garcilasso de la Vega, who, moreover,
was believed to be prejudiced owing to his
relationship to the Incas. Sarmiento and Cieza
de Leon are one and the same, so that the number
of authorities for human sacrifices is reduced to
five. Cieza de Leon, Montesinos, and Balboa
adopted the belief that human sacrifices were
offered up, through a misunderstanding of the
words <i>yuyac</i> and <i>huahua</i>. Acosta had little or
no acquaintance with the language, as is proved
by the numerous linguistic blunders in his work.
Ondegardo wrote at a time when he scarcely
knew the language, and had no interpreters; for
it was in 1554, when he was judge at Cuzco. At
that time all the annalists and old men had fled
into the forests, because of the insurrection of
Francisco Hernandez Giron.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The authorities who deny the practice are numerous
and important. These are Francisco de
Chaves, one of the best and most able of the
original conquerors; Juan de Oliva; the Licentiate
Alvarez; Fray Marcos Jofre; the Licentiate
Falcon, in his <i>Apologia pro Indis</i>; Melchior
Hernandez, in his dictionary, under the words
<i>harpay</i> and <i>huahua</i>; the anonymous Jesuit in
his most valuable narrative; and Garcilasso de
la Vega. These eight authorities outweigh the
five quoted by Prescott, both as regards number
and importance. So that the evidence against
human sacrifices is conclusive. The <i>Quipus</i>, as
the anonymous Jesuit tells us, also prove that
there was a law prohibiting human sacrifices.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The assertion that 200 children and 1,000 men
were sacrificed at the coronation of Huayua Ccapac
was made; but these “<i>huahuas</i>” were not
children of men, but young lambs, which are
called children; and the “<i>yuyac</i>” and “<i>runa</i>”
were not men, but adult llamas. [Mr. Markham
has elsewhere collated the authorities on this
point (<i>Royal Commentaries</i>, i. 139). Cf. Bollaert’s
<i>Antiq. Researches</i>, p. 124; and Alphonse
Castaing on “Les Fêtes, Offrandes et Sacrifices
dans l’Antiquité Peruvienne,” in the <i>Archives de
la Société Américaine de France</i>, n. s. iii. 239.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

The sacrificial llamas bore the names of the
youths who presented them. Hence the Spanish
writers, with little or no knowledge of the
language, assumed that the youths themselves
were the victims. (See <i>ante</i>, p. 237.)</p>

Of the first class were the <i>Tarpuntay</i>, or
sacrificing priests, and the <i>Nacac</i>, who cut up
the victims and provided the offerings, whether
<i>harpay</i> or bloody sacrifices, <i>haspay</i> or bloodless
sacrifices of flesh, or <i>cocuy</i>, oblations of corn,
fruit, or coca. Molina mentions a custom called
<i>Ccapac-cocha</i> or <i>Cacha-huaca</i>, being the distribution
of sacrifices. An enormous tribute came to
Cuzco annually for sacrificial purposes, and was
thence distributed by the Inca, for the worship
of every huaca in the empire. The different sacrifices
were sent from Cuzco in all directions for
delivery to the priests of the numerous <i>huacas</i>.
The ministering priests were called <i>Huacap
Uillac</i> when they had charge of a special idol,
<i>Huacap Rimachi</i> or <i>Huatuc</i> when they received
utterances from a deity while in a state of ecstatic
frenzy called <i>utirayay</i>, and <i>Ychurichuc</i>
when they received confessions and ministered
in private families. The soothsayers were a
very numerous class. The <i>Hamurpa</i> examined
the entrails of sacrifices, and divined by the
flight of birds. The <i>Llayca</i>, <i>Achacuc</i>, <i>Huatuc</i>,
and <i>Uira-piricuc</i> were soothsayers of various
grades. The <i>Socyac</i> divined by maize heaps, the
<i>Pacchacuc</i> by the feet of a large hairy spider, the
<i>Llaychunca</i> by odds and evens. The recluses
were not only <i>Aclla-cuna</i>, or virgins congregated
in temples under the charge of matrons called
<i>Mama-cuna</i>. There were also hermits who meditated
in solitary places, and appear to have been
under a rule, with an abbot called <i>Tucricac</i>, and
younger men serving a novitiate called <i>Huamac</i>.
These <i>Huancaquilli</i>, or hermits, took vows of
chastity (<i>titu</i>), obedience (<i>Huñicui</i>), poverty (<i>uscacuy</i>),
and penance (<i>villullery</i>).</p>

[The general works on the Inca civilization
necessarily touch these points of their religious
customs, and Mr. Markham’s volume on the
<i>Rites and Laws of the Incas</i> is a prime source of

Von Tschudi (p. 151) gives references; but special
mention may be made of Müller’s <i>Geschichte

The Quichua language was spoken over a
vast area of the Andean region of South America.
The dialects only differ slightly, and even the
language of the Collas, called by the Spaniards
Aymara, is identical as regards the grammatical
structure, while a clear majority of the words
are the same. The general language of Peru
belongs to that American group of languages
which has been called agglutinative by William
von Humboldt. These languages form new
words by a process of junction which is much
more developed in them than in any of the forms
of speech in the Old World. They also have
exclusive and inclusive plurals, and transitional
forms of the verb combined with pronominal
suffixes which are peculiar to them. In these
respects the Quichua is purely an American language,
and in spite of the resemblances in the
sounds of some words, which have been diligently
collected by Lopez (<i>Les Races Aryennes
du Pérou</i>, par Vicente F. Lopez, Paris, 1871) and
Ellis (<i>Peruvia Scythica</i>, by Robert Ellis, B. D.,
London, 1875), no connection, either as regards
grammar or vocabulary, has been satisfactorily
established between the speech of the Incas
and any language of the Old World. Quichua
is a noble language, with a most extensive vocabulary,
rich in forms of the plural number,
which argue a very clear conception of the idea
of plurality; rich in verbal conjugations; rich in
the power of forming compound nouns; rich in
varied expression to denote abstract ideas; rich
in words for relationships which are wanting in
the Old World idioms; and rich, above all, in
synonyms: so that it was an efficient vehicle
wherewith to clothe the thoughts and ideas of a
people advanced in civilization.</p>

The truth of this use of gold by the Incas
does not depend on the glowing descriptions of
Garcilasso de la Vega. A golden breastplate
and <i>topu</i>, a golden leaf with a long stalk, four
specimens of golden fruit, and a girdle of gold
were found near Cuzco in 1852, and sent to the
late General Echenique, then President of Peru.
The present writer had an opportunity of inspecting
and making careful copies of them. His
drawings of the breastplate and <i>topu</i> were lithographed
for Bollaert’s <i>Antiquarian Researches in
Peru</i>, p. 146. The breastplate was 5-3/10 inches
in diameter, and had four narrow slits for suspending
it round the neck. The golden leaf was
12-7/10 inches long, including the stem; breadth
of the base of the leaf, 3-1/10 inches. The models
of fruit were 3 inches in diameter, and the
girdle 18¼ inches long.</p>

“The stones are of various sizes in different
structures, ranging in length from one to eight
feet, and in thickness from six inches to two feet.
The larger stones are generally at the bottom,
each course diminishing in thickness towards
the top of the wall, thus giving a very pleasing
effect of graduation. The joints are of a precision
unknown in our architecture, and not rivalled
in the remains of ancient art in Europe. The
statement of the old writers, that the accuracy
with which the stones of some structures were
fitted together was such that it was impossible
to introduce the thinnest knife-blade or finest
needle between them, may be taken as strictly
true. The world has nothing to show in the way
of stone cutting and fitting to surpass the skill
and accuracy displayed in the Inca structures of
Cuzco.”</p>

<p class="pfc4">7. <i>Yma huayna</i>, “As a youth.” Age 20 to 25.</p>

<p class="pfc4">A <i>Chunca</i> consisted of ten <i>Purics</i>, with the
other classes in proportion. The <i>Puric</i> was
married to one wife, and, while assisted by the
young lads and the elderly men, he supported
the children and the old people who could not
work. The Peruvian laborer had many superstitions,
but he was not devoid of higher religious
feelings. This is shown by his practice when
travelling. On reaching the summit of a pass
he never forgot to throw a stone, or sometimes
his beloved pellet of coca, on a heap by the roadside,
as a thank-offering to God, exclaiming,
<i>Apachicta muchani!</i> “I worship or give thanks
at this heap.” Festivals lightened his days of
toil by their periodical recurrence, and certain
family ceremonials were also recognized as occasions
for holidays. There was a gathering at
the cradling of a child, called <i>quirau</i>. When
the child attained the age of one year, the <i>rutuchicu</i>
took place. Then he received the name
he was to retain until he attained the age of puberty.
The child was closely shorn, and the
name was given by the eldest relation. With a
girl the ceremony was called <i>quicuchica</i>, and
there was a fast of two days imposed before the
naming-day, when she assumed the dress called
<i>aucalluasu</i>.</p>

The <i>tupu</i> was a measure of land sufficient
to support one man and his wife. It was the
unit of land measurement, and a <i>puric</i> received
<i>tupus</i> according to the number of those dependent
on him. In parts of Peru, especially on the
road from Tarma to Xauxa, these small square
fields, or <i>tupus</i>, may still be seen in great numbers,
divided by low stone walls.</p>

The shares for the <i>Inca</i> and <i>Huaca</i> varied

of the <i>Huaca</i>, but never at the expense of

We learn from Leon Pinelo that one of the famous band of adventurers who crossed the line drawn by
Pizarro on the sands of Gallo was an author (Antonio, ii. 645). But the <i>Relacion de la tierra que descubrió
Don Francisco Pizarro</i>, by Diego de Truxillo, remained in manuscript and is lost to us. Francisco de Chaves,
one of the most respected of the companions of Pizarro, who strove to save the life of Atahualpa, and was an
intimate friend of the Inca’s brother, was also an author. Chaves is honorably distinguished for his moderation
and humanity. He lost his own life in defending the staircase against the assassins of Pizarro. He left
behind a copious narrative, and his intimate relations with the Indians make it likely that it contained much
valuable information respecting Inca civilization. It was inherited by the author’s friend and relation, Luis
Valera, but it was never printed, and the manuscript is now lost. The works of Palomino, a companion of
Belalcazar, who wrote on the kingdom of Quito, are also lost, with the exception of a fragment preserved in
the <i>Breve Informe</i> of Las Casas. Other soldiers of the conquest, Tomas Vasquez, Francisco de Villacastin,
Garcia de Melo, and Alonso de Mesa, are mentioned as men who had studied and were learned in all matters
relating to Inca antiquities; but none of their writings have been preserved.</p>

Acosta was the chief source whence the civilized world of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, beyond
the limits of Spain, derived a knowledge of Peruvian civilization. Purchas, in his <i>Pilgrimage</i> (ed. of 1623,
lib. v. p. 869; vi. p. 931), quotes largely from the learned Jesuit, and an abstract of his work is given in Harris’s
<i>Voyages</i> (lib. i. cap. xiii. pp. 751-799). He is much relied upon as an authority by Robertson, and is quoted
19 times in Prescott’s <i>Conquest of Peru</i>, thus taking the fourth place as an authority with regard to that work,
since Garcilasso is quoted 89 times, Cieza de Leon 45, Ondegardo 41, Acosta 19.</p>

Of whose parentage a pleasing story is told. He was a native of Truxillo, of French parents, his father
being a metal-founder. When he was a small boy his father said to him, “Study, little Charles, study! and
this bell that I am founding shall be rung for you when you are the bishop.” (“Estudiar, Carlete, estudiar!
que con esta campana te han de repicar cuando seas obispo.”) Dr. Corni rose to be a prelate of great virtue
and erudition, and an eloquent preacher. At last he became Bishop of Truxillo in 1620, and when he heard
the chimes which were rung on his approach to the city, he said, “That bell which excels all the others was
founded by my father.” (“Aquella campana que sobresale entre las demas le fundio mi padre.”)</p>

We first hear of Sarmiento in a memorial dated at Cuzco on March 4, 1572, in which he says that he was
the author of a history of the Incas, now lost. We further gather that, owing to having found out from the
records of the Incas that Tupac Inca Yupanqui discovered two islands in the South Sea, called <i>Ahuachumpi</i>
and <i>Ninachumpi</i>, Sarmiento sailed on an expedition to discover them at some time previous to 1564. Balboa
also mentions the tradition of the discovery of these islands by Tupac Yupanqui. Sarmiento seems to have
discovered islands which he believed to be those of the Inca, and in 1567 he volunteered to command the
expedition dispatched by Lope de Castro, then governor of Peru, to discover the Terra Australis. But Castro
gave the command to his own relation, Mandana. We learn, however, from the memorial of Sarmiento, that
he accompanied the expedition, and that the first land was discovered through shaping a course in accordance
with his advice. Sarmiento submitted a full report of this first voyage of Mandana, which is now lost, to the
Viceroy Toledo. In 1579, Sarmiento was sent to explore the Straits of Magellan. In 1586, on his way to
Spain, he was captured by an English ship belonging to Raleigh, and was entertained hospitably by Sir Walter
at Durham House until his ransom was collected. From the Spanish captive his host obtained much information
respecting Peru and its Incas. He could have no higher authority. One of the journals of the survey of
Magellan Straits by Sarmiento was published at Madrid in 1768: <i>Viage al estrecho de Magellanes: por el
Capitan Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, en los años 1579 y 1580</i>. See Vol. II. p. 616.</p>

This superb work was issued at Berlin and London with German and English texts. The English title
reads, <i>Peruvian Antiquities: the Necropolis of Ancon in Peru. A contribution to our knowledge of the culture
and industries of the empire of the Incas. Being the results of excavations made on the spot.</i> Translated
by A. H. Keane. With the aid of the general administration of the royal museums of Berlin (Berlin,
1880-87); in three folio volumes, with 119 colored and plain plates. The divisions are: 1. The Necropolis and
its graves. 2. Garments and textiles. 3. Ornaments, utensils, earthenware; evolution of ornamentation, with
treatises by L. Wittmack on the plants found in the graves; R. Virchow on the human remains, and A. Nehring
on the animals. [A few of the plates are reproduced in black and white in Ruge’s <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters
der Entdeckungen</i>. The authors represent that the graveyard of Ancon, an obscure place lying near the
coast, north of Lima, was probably the burial-place of a poor people; but its obscurity has saved it to us while
important places have been ransacked and destroyed. The reader will be struck with the richness of the woven
materials, which are so strikingly figured in the plates. On this point Stübel published in Dresden in 1888, as
a part of the <i>Festschrift</i> of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the “Verein für Erdkunde,” a paper <i>Ueber altperuanische
Gewebemuster und ihnen analoge Ornamente der altklassischen Kunst</i> (Dresden, 1888). Some of
the plates in the larger work impress one with the great variety of ornamenting skill. The collection formed by
John H. Blake from an ancient cemetery on the bay of Chacota, now in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge,
Mass., is described in the <i>Reports</i> of that institution, xi. 195, 277. Reference may also be made to B. M.

A most graphic and picturesque account of
the ceremonies attending the process of adoption
is given in the <i>Narrative of the Captivity of
Col. James Smith</i>. He was taken prisoner, in
May, 1755, by two Delaware Indians, and carried
to Fort Duquesne. He describes the methods
of the men and the women in an Indian town
by which he was adopted as one of the Caughnewagos.
He shared the life and rovings of the
tribe till 1760, when he got back to his home;
accompanied Bouquet as a guide; was colonel
of a regiment in our Revolutionary War, and
afterwards a member of the Kentucky legislature.
Here certainly was a varied career.</p>

Governor Colden says that when he first
went among the Mohawks he was adopted by
them. The name given to him was “Cayenderogue,”
which was borne by an old sachem, a
notable warrior. He writes: “I thought no
more of it at that time than as an artifice to draw
a belly-full of strong liquor from me for himself
and his companions. But when, about ten or
twelve years after, my business led me among
them,” he was recognized by the name, and it
served him in good stead. (<i>Hist. of Five Nats.</i>,
3d ed., i. p. 11.) The savages always took the
liberty of assigning names of their own, either
general or individual, to the Europeans with
whom they had intercourse. The governor of
Canada, for the time being, was called “Onontio”;
of New York, “Corlear”; of Virginia,
“Assarigoa”; of Pennsylvania, “Onas,” etc.
At a council of the Six Nations with the governors
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland,
held at Lancaster in June, 1744, it came under
notice that the governor of Maryland had as
yet no appellation assigned him by the natives.
Much formality was used in providing one for
him. It was tried by lot as to which of the
tribes should have the honor of naming him.
The lot fell to the Cayugas, one of whose chiefs,
after solemn deliberation, assigned the name
“To-carryhogan.” (Colden, ii. p. 89.)</p>

The most capable and intelligent interpreter
employed by the English for a long period, and
who served at the councils for negotiating the
most important treaties of this time, was Conrad
Weiser. He came with his family from
Germany in 1710, and settled at Schoharie,
N. Y. His ability and integrity won him the
confidence alike of the Indians and the English.
In the <i>Collections of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania</i>,
vol. i. pp. 1-34, are autobiographical,
personal, and narrative papers and journals by
this remarkable man, equally characterized by
the boldest spirit of adventure and by an ardent
piety. He gives in full his journal of his mission
from the governments of Pennsylvania and
Virginia to negotiate with the Six Nations in
1737. [See Vol. V. 566.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Governor Dinwiddie, in urging the assembly
of Virginia, in 1756, to active war measures,
warned them of the alternative of “giving up
your Liberty for Slavery, the purest Religion for
the grossest Idolatry and Superstition, the legal
and mild Government of a Protestant King for
the Arbitrary Exactions and heavy Oppressions
of a Popish Tyrant.” (<i>Dinwiddie Papers</i>, ii. p.

The excellent James Logan, who came over
as secretary to William Penn, and who always
claimed to be a consistent member of the Society
of Friends, took an exception to a position on
one point,&mdash;that of maintaining the right, and
even obligation, of defensive warfare. A letter of
very cogent argument to this effect was addressed
by him to the Society of Friends in 1741, remonstrating
with them for their opposition in the
legislature to means for defending the colony.

It was but a repetition of the passions and
jealousies of the colonists of Massachusetts, as
maddened by the devastation inflicted upon
them in King Philip’s war, when they themselves
broke up the settlements, then under
hopeful promise, of “Praying Indians,” at Natick
and other villages, the fruits of the devoted
labors of the Apostle Eliot. The occasion of
this dispersion and severe watch over the Indian
converts was a jealousy that they had been
warmed in the bosom of a weak pity merely
for a deadly use of their fangs.</p>

The bibliography of the subject is nowhere exhaustively done. The <i>Proof-sheets</i> of Pilling as a tentative
effort, and his later divisionary sections, devoted to the Eskimo, Siouan, and other stocks, though primarily
framed for their linguistic bearing, are the chief help; and these guides can be supplemented by Field’s Indian
<i>Bibliography</i>, the references for anonymous books in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i> (ix. p. 86), and sections in many
catalogues of public and private libraries, like the Brinley (iii. 5, 352 etc.), devoted wholly or in part to Americana,
and the foot-notes and authorities given in Parkman, H. H. Bancroft, and many others.</p>

The question has often been discussed as to the origin of the title of “Indian summer,” as applied to a
beautiful portion of our autumnal season. Dr. Doddridge gives us an explanation of its original significance,
or, at least, of an association with it, which would make a feeling of dread rather than of romance its most
striking suggestion. He says that to a backwoodsman the term in its original import would cause a chill of
horror. The explanation is as follows: The white settlers on the frontiers found no peace from Indian alarms
and onsets save in the winter. From spring to the early part of the autumn, the settlers, cooped up in the
forts, or ever at watch in their fields, had no security or comfort. The approach of winter was hailed as a
jubilee in cabin and farm, with bustle and hilarity. But after the first set-in of winter aspects came a longer
or shorter interval of warm, smoky, hazy weather, which would tempt the Indians&mdash;as if a brief return of
summer&mdash;to renew their incursions on the frontiers. The season, then, was an “Indian summer” only for
blood and mischief. So the spell of warm open weather, of melting snows, in the latter part of February&mdash;a
premature spring&mdash;was a period of dread for the frontiersmen. It was called the “pawwawing days,” as
the Indians were then holding their incantations and councils for rehearsing for their spring war-parties.</p>

There are notices of other books of this kind in Vols. V. and VII. of the present History. Particularly,
may be mentioned Joseph Pritt’s <i>Mirror of Olden Time</i> (Chambersburg, Va., 1848; 2d ed., Abingdon, Va.,
1849), in which the most interesting portions are the personal narratives of such captives to the Indians as
Col. James Smith, John M’Cullough, and others, the full credibility of which is vouched for by those who
knew them as neighbors and associates. This class of narratives by men who for years, willingly or unwillingly,
affiliated with their wild captors make very intelligible to us the fact that the whites are much more
readily Indianized than are Indians led to conform to the ways of civilization. Cf. Archibald Loudon’s <i>Selection
of some of the most interesting narratives, of outrages, committed by the Indians, in their wars with
the white people. Also, an account of their manners, customs, traditions, etc.</i> (Carlisle, 1808-11; Harrisburg,

For diversity of opinions respecting it see Allibone’s <i>Dictionary</i>. The modern scientific historian and
ethnologist think in conjunction in giving it a low rank compared with what such a book should be. The
fullest account of the bibliography of this and of Schoolcraft’s other books is in Pilling’s <i>Proof-sheets</i>. Whatever
credit may accrue to Schoolcraft is kept out of sight in the title-page of a condensation of the book, which
has some interspersed additions from other sources, all of which are obscurely included, so that the authorship
of them is uncertain. The book is called <i>The Indian Tribes of the United States, edited by F. S. Drake</i>
(Philad., 1884), in 2 vols. There is another conglomerate and useful book, edited by W. W. Beach, <i>The Indian
Miscellany; papers on the history, antiquities [etc.] of the American aborigines</i> (Albany, 1877), which is a

This was the earliest of Morgan’s important writings on the Iroquois, but the full outcome of all his
views on the Indian character and life can only be studied by following him through his later <i>Ancient Society</i>,
his <i>Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity</i>, and his <i>Houses and House-life of the American Aborigines</i>.
Cf. Pilling’s <i>Proof-sheets</i> for a conspectus of his works. Morgan’s early studies on the Iroquois sensibly

Sometimes the gravels in which such implements
were originally deposited have disappeared
through denudation or other natural
causes, leaving the implements on the surface.
But the outside of such specimens always shows
traces of decomposition, indicating their high
antiquity. Other examples of implements of
like shape, found on the surface in places where
there has been no glacial drift, may be palæolithic,
but their form is no sufficient proof of this,
since they may equally well have been the work
of the Indians, who are known to have fashioned
similar objects.</p>

Waitz, <i>Introd. to Anthropology</i>, Eng. trans., p. 255,
points out the dangers of over-confidence in this research.
Cf. also J. H. McCulloh’s <i>Researches</i> (1829).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The best indications of the sources as respects the origin
of the Americans can be found in Haven’s <i>Archæology of
the United States</i> (<i>Smithsonian Contributions</i>, vii., 1856);

Cf. Sabin, xiv. 59,239, etc., for editions. The original

three vols. in 1770:&mdash;</p>

Dissertation sur l’Amérique et les Américains contre les

<p class="pfc4">There was an edition in French at Berlin in 1770, in 2
vols., and, with Pernetty annexed, in 1774, in 3 vols. The
<i>Defenses</i> was printed also at Berlin in 1770. These were
all included in De Pauw’s <i>Œuvres Philosophiques</i>, published
at Paris “<i>an iii</i>.” An English translation by J.
Thomson was printed at London, 1795. Daniel Webb published
some selections in English at Bath, 1789, 1795, and
at Rochdale, 1806. Pernetty’s <i>Examen</i> was printed at
Berlin in 1769. There is another little tractate of this
time attributed to Pernetty, <i>De l’Amérique et des Américains</i>
(Berlin, 1771), in whose humor De Pauw fares no
better; but Rich has a note on the questionable attributing
of it to Pernetty, and its real author was probably C. de
Bonneville (cf. Hœfer).</p>

The idea in general was not wholly new. Capt. Bernard
Romans, in his <i>Concise Nat. Hist. of East and West
Florida</i> (N. Y., 1776), had expressed the opinion “that
God created an original man and woman in this part of the
globe of different species from any in the other parts”
(p. 38). Clavigero, in 1780, believed that the distinct linguistic
traits of the Americans pointed to something like
an independent origin. Cf. W. D. Whitney on the “Bearing
of Languages on the Unity of Man,” in <i>North Amer.
Review</i>, cv. 214.</p>

Morton’s latest results are given in a paper, “The physical
type of the American Indian,” left unfinished, but
completed by John S. Phillips, and printed in Schoolcraft’s
<i>Indian Tribes</i>, ii. He also printed <i>An Inquiry into the
distinctive characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of
America</i> (Boston, 1842; Philad., 1844); and <i>Some Observations
in the Ethnography and Archæology of the American
Aborigines</i> (N. Haven, 1846,&mdash;from the <i>Amer. Jour.

evident that skull capacity is no sure measure of intelligence,
and the Indian custom of misshaping the head offers
some serious obstacles in the study. Cf. Nadaillac,

He found all three varieties of skulls in America: the
long-headed (dolichocephalic), the short-headed (brachycephalic),
and the medium (mesocephalic). He found the
long heads to predominate, except in Peru. Meigs had
earlier studied the subject in his <i>Observations on the Form
of the Occiput</i> (Philad., 1860). Cf. Busk in <i>Jour. Anthrop.

H. H. Bancroft, <i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 129, 131, gives references
on the autochthonous theory. It is held by Nadaillac,
<i>Les premiers hommes</i>, ii. 117; Fred. von Hellwald in
<i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1866; Bollaert’s “Contribution to an
Introduction to the Anthropology of the New World” in
<i>Memoirs, Anthrop. Society of London</i>, ii. 92; F. Müller,
<i>Allgemeine Ethnographie</i>; and Simonin, <i>L’homme
Américain</i> (Paris, 1870). F. W. Putnam (<i>Report</i> in
<i>Wheeler’s Survey</i>, vii. p. 18) says: “The primitive race
of America was as likely autochthonous and of Pliocene
age as of Asiatic origin.” The autochthonous view is
probably losing ground. Dall, in ch. 10, appended to the
English translation of Nadaillac’s <i>Prehistoric America</i>,
sums up the prevailing arguments against it. Cf. also
Dabry de Thiersant’s <i>Origine des Indiens du Nouveau

Again he says: “Man may be assumed to be prehistoric
wherever his chroniclings of himself are undesigned,
and his history is wholly recoverable by induction. The
term has, strictly speaking, no chronological significance;
but in its relative application corresponds to other archæological,
in contradistinction to geological periods.” Of
America he says: “A continent where man may be studied
under circumstances which seem to furnish the best guarantee
of his independent development.” Dawkins (<i>Cave
hunting</i>, 136) says: “For that series of events which extends
from the borders of history back to the remote age,
where the geologist, descending the stream of time, meets
the archæologist, I have adopted the term <i>prehistoric</i>.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">The divisions of prehistoric time now most commonly employed
are: For the oldest, the Palæolithic age, as Lubbock
first termed it, which, with a shadowy termination, has an
unknown beginning, covering an interval geologically of
vast extent. It is the primitive stone age, the epoch of
flint-chippers; and but a single positive vestige of any community
of living is known to archæologists: the village of
Solutré, in Eastern France, being held by some to be associated
with man in this earlier stage of his development.
This stone period is sometimes divided in Europe into an
earlier and later period, representing respectively the men
of the river drift and of the caves. In the first period,
called sometimes that of the race of Canstadt, and by Mortillet
the Chellean period, we have, as is claimed, a savage
hunter race, represented by the Neanderthal skull; and
because in two jaw-bones discovered the genial tubercle is
undeveloped, a school of archæologists contend that the
race was speechless (Horatio Hale’s “Origin of Language,”
in <i>Am. Asso. Adv. Sci. Proc.</i>, xxxv., Cambridge,
1886; and separate, p. 31). This theory, however, seems
to rest on a misconception. Cf. Topinard on the jaw-bone
from the Naulette cave in the <i>Revue d’Anthropologie</i>, 3d
ser. i., p. 422 (1886). It is held that the ethnical relations
of this race are unknown, and it is not palpably connected
with the race of the later period, the race of the caves, which
archæologists, like Carl Vogt, Lartet, and Christy, call the
cave-bear epoch, as its evidences are found in the cave
deposits of Europe.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="pfc4">This cave race is represented by the Cro-magnon skull,
and, as Dawkins holds, is perpetuated to-day by the Eskimo,
and was very likely also represented in the Guanches of the
Canary Islands. Quatrefages calls it the race of Cro-magnon;
and the vanishing of it into the Neolithic people is
obscure. It is claimed by some, but the evidence is questionable,
that the development of the muscles of speech
make this race the first to speak, and that thus man, as a
speaking being, is probably not ten thousand years old.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The interval before the shaped and polished stone implements
were used may have been long in some places, and
the gradation may have been confused in others; and it is
indeed sometimes said that the one and the other condition
exist in savage regions at the present day, as many archæologists
hold that they have always existed, side by side,
though this proposition is also denied. Indeed, it is a
question if the terms of the archæologist, signifying ages
or epochs, have any time value, being rather characteristics
of stages of development than of passing time. Those who
find the ruder implements to stand for a people living with
the cave-bear find, as they contend, a shorter-headed race
producing these finer stone implements, and call it the
Reindeer epoch. One of Lubbock’s terms, the Neolithic
age, has gained larger acceptance as a designation for this
period since 1865, when he introduced it. With these
polished stones we first find signs of domestic animals
and of the practice of agriculture. Any considerable collection
of these stone implements and ornaments will present
to the observer great varieties, but with steady types,
of such implements as axes, celts, hammers, knives, drills,
scrapers, mortars and pestles, pitted stones, plummets, sinkers,
spear-points, arrow-heads, daggers, pipes, gorgets,&mdash;not
to name others.</p>

Vols. iii. and iv. of this treatise (Leipzig, 1862-64) are
given to “Die Amerikaner,” and are provided with a list of
books on the subject, and ethnological maps of North and
South America. Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, p. 40) thinks it the best
work yet written on the American Indians, though he
thinks that Waitz errs on the religious aspects. Waitz has
fully discussed the question of climate as affecting the
development of people, and this is included with full references
in that part of his great work which in the English
translation is called an <i>Introduction to Anthropology</i>.
Wallace and other observers contend that the direct efficacy
of physical conditions is overrated, and that climate is but
one of the many factors. F. H. Cushing discusses the

London, N. Y., 1865; 2d ed. somewhat enlarged, Lond.,
1869; and later. Part of this work had appeared earlier in
the <i>National Hist. Review</i>, 1861-64, including a paper (ch.
8) on No. Amer. Archæology in Jan., 1863, which was reprinted
in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i> for 1862, and was translated
in the <i>Revue Archéologique</i>, 1865.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This book of Lubbock’s and Tylor’s correlative work
probably represent the best dealing with the subject in
English; and some such book as Jas. A. Farrer’s <i>Primitive
Manners and Customs</i> (N. Y., 1879) will lead up to
them with readers less studious. The English reader may
find some comparative treatments in the English version of
Waitz’s <i>Introd. to Anthropology</i> (p. 284), etc.; much that
is suggestive and in some way supplemental to Tylor and
Lubbock in Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i>; some vigorous and
perhaps sweeping characterizations in Lesley’s <i>Origin and
Destiny of Man</i> (ch. 6); and other aspects in Winchell’s
<i>Preadamites</i> (ch. 26), Foster’s <i>Prehistoric Races of the
U. S.</i> (ch. 9), F. A. Allen in <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des

Darwin took Lubbock’s side, <i>Descent of Man</i>, i. 174.
Bradford, in his <i>American Antiquities</i>, held the barbarous
American to be a degraded remnant of a society originally
more cultivated; and a similar view was held by S. F.
Jarvis in his <i>Discourse</i> before the New York Hist. Soc.
(Proc., iii., N. Y., 1821). Cf. Büchner’s <i>Man</i>, Eng. transl.,

Dawson’s <i>Fossil Men and their modern representatives</i>
(London, 1880, 1883) is “an attempt to illustrate the
characters and conditions of prehistoric men in Europe by
those of the American races.” A conservative reliance on
the biblical record, as long understood, characterizes Dawson’s
usual speculations. Cf. his <i>Nature and the Bible</i>,
his <i>Story of the Earth</i>, his <i>Origin of the World</i>, and his
<i>Address</i> as president of the geological section of the
Amer. Association in 1876. He confronts his opponents’
views of the long periods necessary to effect geographical
changes by telling them that in historic times “the Hyrcanian
ocean has dried up and Atlantis has gone down.”</p>

This is also considered important evidence by Dawson,
as well as Winchell’s estimate, in his <i>5th Report, Minnesota
Geol. Survey</i> (1876), of the 8,000 or 9,000 years necessary
for the falls of St. Anthony to have worked back from Fort
Snelling. Edw. Fontaine’s <i>How the World was peopled</i>

belief.</p>

This cataclysmic element of force, as opposed to the
gradual uniformity theory of Lyell, finds expounders in
Huxley and Prestwich, and is the burden of H. H. Howorth’s
<i>Mammoth and the Flood</i> (London, 1887) in its
palæontological and archæological aspects, its geological
aspects having been touched by him so far only in some
papers in the <i>Geological Mag.</i> This great overthrow of
the gigantic animals, during which the man intermediate
between the palæolithic and neolithic age lived, was not
universal, so that the less unwieldy species largely saved
themselves; and it was in effect the scriptural flood, of
which traditions were widely preserved among the North
American tribes (<i>Mammoth and the Flood</i>, 307, 444).</p>

Cf. also J. D. Whitney’s <i>Climatic Changes</i>. The
present proportion of land to water is reckoned as four is
to eleven. The ocean’s average depth is variously estimated
at from eleven to thirteen times that of the average elevation
of land above water, or as 11,000 or 13,000 feet is to
1,000 feet. The bulk of water on the globe is computed
at thirty-six times the cubic measurement of the land above
water (<i>Ibid.</i> 194, 209).</p>

It is enough to indicate the necessary correlation of
this subject with the transformation theory of J. B. A. Lamarck
as enunciated in his <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> (Paris,
1809; again, 1873), which Cuvier opposed; and with the
new phase of it in what is called Darwinism, a theory of
the survival of the fittest, leading ultimately to man.
Lyell (<i>Principles of Geology</i>, 11th ed., ii, 495) presents
the diverse sides of the question, which is one hardly germane
to our present purpose.</p>

Another way of looking at it gives reasons for this
omission: “The first chapter of Genesis is not a geological
treatise. It is absolutely valueless in geological discussion,
and has no value whatever save as representing what the
Jews borrowed from the Babylonians, and as preserving for
us an early cosmology” (Howorth’s <i>Mammoth and the
Flood</i>, Lond., 1887, p. ix). Between Lyell and Gabriel de
Mortillet (<i>La préhistorique Antiquité de l’Homme</i>, Paris,
1881) on the one hand and Southall on the other, there are
the more cautious geologists, like Prestwich, who claim that
we must wait before we can think of measuring by years
the interval from the earliest men. (Cf. “Theoretical
considerations on the drift containing implements,” in <i>Roy.
Soc. Philos. Trans.</i>, 1862)</p>

Lois Agassiz advanced (1863) this view of the first
emergence of land in America, in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
xi. 373; also in <i>Geol. Sketches</i>, p. 1,&mdash;marking the Laurentian
hills along the Canadian borders of the United
States as the primal continent. Cf. Nott and Gliddon’s
<i>Types of Mankind</i>, ch. 9. Mortillet holds that so late
as the early quaternary period Europe was connected with
America by a region now represented by the Faröes, Iceland,
and Greenland. Some general references on the

Dr. Brinton concludes that since the region is one of a

quaternary. The track here figured was 9½ inches long;
some were 10 inches. The maximum stride was 18 inches.

“We cannot fix a date, in the historical sense, for
events which happened outside history, and cannot measure
the antiquity of man in terms of years.” Dawkins in <i>No.
Am. Rev.</i>, Oct., 1883, p. 338. Tylor (<i>Early Hist. of
Mankind</i>, 197) says “Geological evidence, though capable
of showing the lapse of vast periods of time, has scarcely
admitted of these periods being brought into definite chronological
terms.” Prestwich (<i>On the geol. position and
age of flint-implement-bearing beds</i>, London, 1864,&mdash;from
the <i>Roy. Soc. Phil. Trans.</i>) says: “However we extend
our present chronology with respect to the first appearance
of men, it is at present unsafe and premature to count by
hundreds of thousands of years.” Southall (<i>Recent Origin
of Man</i>, ch. 33) epitomizes the extreme views of the advocates
of glaciation in the present temperate zone.</p>

J. Adhémer, <i>Revolutions de la Mer</i>, who advocates this
theory, connects with it the movement of the apsides, and
thinks that it is the consequent great accumulation of ice at
the north pole which by its weight displaces the centre of
gravity; and as the action is transferred from one pole to
the other, the periodic oscillation of that centre of gravity
is thus caused. The theory no doubt borrows something of
its force with some minds from the great law of mutability
in nature. That it is a grand field for such theorizers as
Lorenzo Burge, his <i>Preglacial Man and the Aryan Race</i>
shows; but authorities like Lyell and Sir John Herschel
find no sufficient reason in it for the great ice-sheet which
they contend for. Cf. H. Le Hon’s <i>Influence des lois
cosmiques sur la climatologie et la géologie</i> (Bruxelles,
1868). W. B. Galloway’s <i>Science and Geology in relation
to the Universal Deluge</i> (Lond., 1888) points out what he
thinks the necessary effects of such changes of axis. J. D.
Whitney (<i>Climatic changes of later geological times,
Mem. Mus. Comp. Zoöl.</i>, vii. 392, 394) disbelieves all
these views, and contends that the most eminent astronomers
and climatologists are opposed to them.</p>

Of the manifold reasons which have been assigned for
these great climatic changes (Lubbock, <i>Prehistoric Times</i>,
391, and Croll, <i>Discussions</i>, enumerates the principal reasons)
there is at least some considerable credence given to the one
of which James Croll has been the most prominent advocate,
and which points to that reduction of the eccentricity
of the earth’s orbit which in 22,000 years will be diminished
from the present scale to one sixth of it, or to about half a
million miles. This change in the eccentricity induces
physical changes, which allow a greater or less volume of
tropical water to flow north. In this way the once mild
climate of Greenland is accounted for (Wallace’s <i>Island
Life</i>). Croll first advanced his views in the Philosophical
Mag., Aug., 1864; but he did not completely formulate his
theory till in his <i>Climate and time in their geological
relations, a theory of secular changes of the earth’s
climate</i> (N. Y., 1875). It gained the acquiescence of Lyell
and others; but a principal objector appeared in the astronomer
Simon Newcomb (<i>Amer. Jl. of Sci. and Arts</i>,
April, 1876; Jan., 1884; <i>Philosoph. Mag.</i>, Feb., 1884).
Croll answered in <i>Remarks</i> (London, 1884), but more
fully in a further development of his views in his <i>Discussions
on Climate and Cosmology</i> (N. Y., 1886). Whitney’s
<i>Climatic Changes</i> argues on entirely different grounds.</p>

Foster, <i>Prehistoric Races</i>, 50, notes some obscure
facts which might indicate that man lived back of the
glacial times, in the Miocene tertiary period. These are
the discoveries associated with the names of Desnoyers and
the Abbé Bourgeois, and familiar enough to geologists.
They have found little credence. Cf. Lubbock’s <i>Prehistoric
Times</i>, 410, and his <i>Scientific Lectures</i>, 140; Büchner’s
<i>Man</i>, p. 31; Nadaillac’s <i>Les Premiers Hommes</i>, ii,
425; and <i>L’Homme tertiaire</i> (Paris, 1885); Peschel’s
<i>Races of Men</i>, p. 34; Edward Clodd in <i>Modern Review</i>,
July, 1880; Dawkins’ <i>Address</i>, Salford, 1877, p. 9; Joly,
<i>Man before Metals</i>, 177. Quatrefages (<i>Human Species</i>,
N. Y., 1879, p. 150) assents to their authenticity. Many of
these look to the later tertiary (Pliocene) as the beginning
of the human epoch; but Dawkins (<i>No. Am. Rev.</i>, cxxxvii,
338; cf. his <i>Early Man in Britain</i>, p. 90), as well as Huxley,
say that all real knowledge of man goes not back of
the quaternary. Cf. further, Quatrefages, <i>Introd. à l’étude
des races humaines</i> (Paris, 1887), p. 91; and his <i>Nat. Hist.
Man</i> (N. Y., 1874), p. 44.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Winchell (McClintock and Strong’s <i>Cyclopædia</i>, viii. 491-2,
and in his <i>Preadamites</i>) concisely classes the evidences of
tertiary man as “Preglacial remains erroneously supposed
human,” and “Human remains erroneously supposed pre-glacial;”
but he confines these conclusions to Europe only,
allowing that the American non-Caucasian man might,
perhaps, be carried back (p. 492) into the tertiary age.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cf. on the tertiary (Pliocene) man, E. S. Morse in
<i>Amer. Naturalist</i>, xviii. 1001,&mdash;an address at the Philad.
meeting, Am. Asso. Adv. Science and his earlier paper
in the <i>No. Amer. Rev.</i>; C. C. Abbott in <i>Kansas City
Rev.</i>, iii. 413 (also see iv. 84, 326); <i>Cornhill Mag.</i>, li. 254
(also in <i>Pop. Sci. Monthly</i>, xxvii. 103, and <i>Eclectic Mag.</i>,
civ. 601). Dr. Morton believed that the Eocene man, of
the oldest tertiary group, would yet be discovered. Agassiz,
in 1865 (<i>Geol. Sketches</i>, 200), thought the younger naturalists
would live to see sufficient proofs of the tertiary
man adduced. S. R. Pattison (<i>Age of Man geologically
considered in Present Day Tract, no. 13</i>, or <i>Journal of
Christ. Philos.</i> July, 1883) does not believe in the tertiary
man, instancing, among other conclusions, that no trace of
cereals is found in the tertiary strata, and that these strata
show other conditions unfavorable to human life. His
conclusions are that man has existed only about 8,000 years,
and that it is impossible for geological science at present to
confute or disprove it. In his view man appeared in the
first stage of the quaternary period, was displaced by
floods in the second, and for the third lived and worked on
the present surface.</p>

<i>Mammoth and the Flood</i> (Lond., 1887), p. 319; J. P. MacLean’s
<i>Mastodon, Mammoth and Man</i> (Cincinnati, 1886).
Cf. references under “Mammoth” and “Mastodon,” in
<i>Poole’s Index</i>. Koch represented that he found the remains
of a mastodon in Missouri, with the proofs about
the relics that the animal had been slain by stone javelins
and arrows (<i>St. Louis Acad. of Sci. Trans.</i>, i. 62, 1857).
The details have hardly been accepted on Koch’s word,
since some doubtful traits of his character have been
made known (Short, <i>No. Amer. of Antiq.</i>, 116; Nadaillac,
<i>L’Amérique préhistorique</i>, 37). There have been
claims also advanced for a stone resembling a hatchet,
found with such animals in the modified drift of Jersey Co.,
Illinois. E. L. Berthoud (<i>Acad. Nat. Sci., Philad. Proc.</i>
1872) has reported on human relics found with extinct animals
in Wyoming and Colorado. Dr. Holmes (<i>Ibid.</i> July,
1859) had described pottery found with the bones of the
megatherium. Lyell seems to have hesitated to associate
man with the extinct animals in America, when the remains
found at Natchez were shown to him in an early visit to
America (<i>Antiquity of Man</i>, 237). Howorth, <i>Mammoth
and the Flood</i>, 317, enumerates the later discoveries, some
being found under recent conditions (<i>Ibid.</i> 278), and so
recent that the trunk itself has been observed (p. 299). In
the earliest instance of the bones being reported, Dr.
Mather, communicating the fact to the <i>Philosophical Trans.
Roy. Soc.</i> (1714), xxix. 63, says they were found in the
Hudson River, and he supposed them the remains of a
giant man, while the colored earth about the bones represented
his rotted body. Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xii.

with that of beasts; and by Lubbock (<i>Prehist. Times</i>, 349)
through the vastly greater numbers of the animals in a hunters’

All the general treatises on American archæology now
cover the subject: Wilson, <i>Prehist. Man</i>, i. 132; Nadaillac,
<i>L’Amérique préhistorique</i>, ch. 2; Short, <i>No. Amer.
Antiq.</i>, 106; <i>Smithsonian Reports</i>, 1864 (Rau), 1866, 1870

<i>Flint Chips</i>, 194. For local observations: J. M. Jones in
<i>Smithsonian Ann. Report</i>, 1863, on those of Nova Scotia.
S. F. Baird in <i>Nat. Museum Proc.</i> (1881, 1882), on those
of New Brunswick and New England. For those in
Maine see <i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>, xvi., xviii.; <i>Central Ohio
Sci. Assoc. Proc.</i>, i. 70; that at Damariscotta, in particular,
is described in the <i>Peabody Mus. Reports</i>, xx. 531, 546; and
in the <i>Maine Hist. Soc. Col.</i>, v. (by P. A. Chadbourne)
and vi. 349. Wyman’s studies are in the <i>Amer. Naturalist</i>,
Jan., 1868, and <i>Peabody Mus. Rept.</i>, ii. Putnam (<i>Essex
Inst. Bull</i>., xv. 86) says that those at Pine Grove, near
Salem, Mass., were examined in 1840. The map which is
annexed of those on Cape Cod, taken from the <i>Smithsonian
Report</i> (1883, p. 905), shows the frequency of them
in a confined area, as observed; but the same region
doubtless includes many not observed.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For those on the New Jersey coast see Cook’s <i>Geology of
New Jersey</i> (Newark, 1868), and Rau in the <i>Smithsonian
Reports</i>, 1863, 1864, 1865. The Lockwood collection from
the heap at Keyport is in the Peabody Museum (cf. <i>Rept.</i>,
xxii. 43). Francis Jordan describes the <i>Remains of an
Aboriginal Encampment at Rehoboth, Delaware</i> (Philad.,
1880). Elmer R. Reynolds reported on “Precolumbian
shell heaps at Newburg, Maryland, and the aboriginal
shell heaps of the Potomac and Wicomico rivers” at the
<i>Congrès des Américanistes</i> (Copenhagen, 1883, p. 292).
Joseph Leidy describes those at Cape Henlopen in the
<i>Phil. Acad. Nat. Sci.</i>, 1866. Those on the Georgia coast,
St. Simon’s Island, etc., are pointed out in C. C. Jones’s
<i>Antiquities of the Southern Indians; Smithsonian Repts.</i>,
1871 (by D. Brown); in Lyell’s <i>Antiq. of Man</i>, and in his
<i>Second Visit to the U. S.</i> (N. Y., 1849), i. 252.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The shell heaps of Florida have had unusual attention.
Wyman has indicated the absence of objects in them, showing
Spanish contact. Dr. Brinton’s first studies of them
were in his <i>Notes on the Floridian Peninsula</i> (Philad.,
1859), ch. 6, and again in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i> (1866),
p. 356. Prof. Wyman’s first reports (St. John River) were
in <i>The American Naturalist</i>, Jan., Oct., Nov., 1868. He
also described them in the <i>Peabody Mus. Report</i>, i., v., vii.,
and in his <i>Fresh Water Shell Heaps of the St. John River,
Florida</i> (Salem, 1875), being no. 4 of the <i>Memoirs of the
Peabody Acad. of Science</i>. There are other investigations
recorded in the <i>Smithsonian Reports</i>, 1877, by S. P. Mayberry,
on St. John River; 1879, by S. T. Walker, on
Tampa Bay; also by A. W. Vogeler in <i>Amer. Naturalist</i>,
Jan., 1879; by W. H. Dall in the <i>American Journal of
Archæology</i>, i. 184; and by A. E. Douglass in the <i>Amer.
Antiquarian</i>, vii. 74, 140. On those of Alabama, see <i>Peabody
Mus. Rept.</i>, xvi. 186, and <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1877.</p>
<p class="pfc4">On those of the great interior valleys, see the <i>Second Geological
Report of Indiana</i>, and Humphrey and Abbott’s
<i>Physics and Hydraulics of the Mississippi Valley</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For the California coast, there is testimony in Bancroft’s
<i>Native Races</i>, iv. 709-712; <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1874 (by
P. Schumacher); <i>American Antiquarian</i>, vii. 159; and
<i>Journal of the Anthropological Institute</i>, v. 489. Schumacher
covers the northwest coast in the <i>Smithsonian
Rept.</i>, 1873. Those in Oregon are reported to be destitute
of the bones of extinct animals, in the <i>Bull. U. S. Geol.
Survey</i>, iii. Bancroft, <i>Nat. Races</i>, iv. 739, refers to those
on Vancouver’s Island. W. H. Dall describes those on the

This branch of archæological science began, I believe,
with the discovery by Sir Wm. R. Wilde of some lacustrine
habitations in a small lake in county Meath. R. Monro’s
<i>Ancient Scotch lake Dwellings</i> (Edinburgh, 1882) has
gathered what is known of the remains in Great Britain.
There are similar remains in various parts of the continent
of Europe; but those revealed by the dry season of 1853-54
in the Swiss lakes have attracted the most notice. Dr.
Keller described them in <i>Reports</i> made to the Archæological
Society of Zurich. A. Morlot printed an abstract
of Keller’s Report in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1863. In
1866, J. E. Lee arranged Keller’s material systematically,
and translated it in <i>The Lake Dwellings of Switzerland
and other parts of Europe, by Ferdinand Keller</i> (London,
1866), which was reissued, enlarged and brought down to
date, in a second edition in 1878. The earliest elaborated
account was Prof. Troyon’s <i>Habitations lacustres</i> (1860),
of which there was a translation in the <i>Smithsonian Reports</i>,
1860, 1861. Troyon and Keller have reached different
conclusions: the one believing that the traces of development
in the remains indicate new peoples coming in,
while Keller holds these to be signs of the progress of the
same people. A paper by Edouard Desor, <i>Palafittes or
Lacustrian Constructions</i>, appeared in English in the
<i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1865. There is a large collection of
typical relics from these lake dwellings in the Peabody
Museum (<i>Report</i>, v.).</p>
<p class="pfc4">These evidences now make part of all archæological treatises:

The man of the Danish peat-beds and of the Swiss lake
dwellings is generally held to belong to the present geological
conditions, but earlier than written records.</p>

Morgan (<i>Systems of Consanguinity</i>, 257) finds correspondence
to the roving Indian in physical and cranial character,
in linguistic traits, and in the similarity of arts and
social habits. Their connection with the moundbuilder
and cliff-dwelling race is traced in H. F. C. Ten Kate’s
<i>Reizen en Onderzolkingen in Nord America</i> (Leyden,
1885). Cushing thinks (<i>Fourth Rept. Bur. Ethnol.</i>, 481)
they got their habit of building in stories from having, as
cliff-dwellers, earlier built on the narrow shelves of the
rocks. Morgan (<i>Peab. Mus. Rept.</i>, xii. 550) thinks their
architectural art deteriorated, since the ruined pueblos are
finer constructions than those inhabited now. Cf. on the
origin of Pueblo architecture V. Mindeleff in <i>Science</i>, ix.

Bancroft (<i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 539) thinks they were connected
in some obscure way with these southern nations,
and in 1875 could write (p. 787) that “most and the best
authorities deem it impossible that the moundbuilders were
ever the remote ancestors of the Indian tribes.” Dawson
(<i>Fossil Men</i>, 55) deems the modern Pueblo Indians to be
their representatives. Brasseur supposes the Toltecs came
from them. (Cf. also Short, 492; and S. B. Evans, in
<i>Kansas City Rev.</i>, March, 1882.) John Wells Foster,
who had for some years written on the subject, gathered his
results in a composite volume, <i>Prehistoric Races of the
United States</i> (Chicago, 1873, 1878, 1881, etc.), in which
he held to the theory of their migrating south and developing
into the civilization of Central America. Cf. his
paper in the <i>Trans. Chicago Acad. Nat. Sci.</i>, vol. i., and
his abstract of it in his <i>Mississippi Valley</i> (1869, p. 415).
J. P. MacLean’s <i>Moundbuilders</i> (Cincinnati, 1879) takes
similar ground. Morgan (<i>Peab. Mus. Rept.</i>, xii. 552) holds
that they cannot be classed with any known Indian “stock,”
and that the “nearest region from which they could have
been derived is New Mexico.” Wills de Haas takes exception
to this view in the <i>Trans. Anthropological Soc.
of Washington</i> (1881). Cf. R. S. Robertson in <i>Compte
Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes</i> (1877), xi. 39.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1733_1733" id="Footnote_1733_1733"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1733_1733"><span class="label">[1733]</span></a></span>
Major Powell says, that years ago he reached the conclusion
that the modern Indians must have raised at least
some of the mounds in the Mississippi Valley (<i>Bur. of
Ethnol. Rept.</i>, iv. p. xxx). Cf. also Powell’s paper in
<i>Science</i>, x. 267. In the second of these reports (p. 117)
Henry W. Henshaw sets forth the views, which the Bureau
maintained; and he defended these views in the <i>Amer.
Antiquarian</i>, viii. 102. The leading member, however, of
the Bureau staff, who is working in this field, is Cyrus
Thomas. In the <i>Nat. Mus. Report</i> (1887) he defined the aim
and character of the <i>Work in Mound Exploration of the
Bureau of Ethnology</i>, also issued separately. In this it
was stated that over 2,000 mounds had been opened, and
38,000 relics gathered from them; but nothing to afford any
clue to the language which the moundbuilders spoke. The
conclusions reached were:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>First</i>, the mounds are as diversified as the Indian tribes
are.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Second</i>, they yield no signs of a superior race.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Third</i>, their builders and the Indians are the same.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Fourth</i>, the accounts of the early European visitors of
the Indians found here correspond to the disclosures of
the mounds.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Fifth</i>, certain kinds of mounds in certain localities are
the work of tribes now known; and there are no signs about
the mounds to connect them with the Pueblo Indians or
those farther south.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Thomas, in the <i>Fifth Report</i> (1888) described the “Burial
Mounds of the northern sections of the U. S.” He says
that the character of the mounds and their contents indicate
the possibility of dividing the territory they occupy
roughly into eight districts, each with some prominent
characteristic, and he roughly distinguishes these
sections as of Wisconsin; the Upper Mississippi; Ohio;
New York; Appalachian; the Middle Mississippi; the
Lower Mississippi and the Gulf. He holds that the
moundbuilding people existed from about the fifth or
sixth century down to historic times.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Taking for his texts the mounds of the Appalachian districts,
he has presented anew his grounds for believing
this region at least to have had the red Indian race for
the constructors of its mounds, and that the Cherokees
were that race. Carr had already (1876), from investigating
a truncated oval mound in Virginia, and comparing it
with Bartram’s (<i>Travels</i>, 365) description of a Cherokee
council-house (<i>Peabody Mus. Rept.</i>, x. 75), reached the
conclusion that that particular mound was built by the
Cherokees. Thomas further undertakes to prove that the
Cherokees once occupied the Appalachian region, and
that implements of the white men are found in some of
the mounds, bringing them down to a period since the
contact with Europeans. The habits of the builders of
these mounds are, as he affirms, known to correspond to
what we know from historic evidence were the habits of
the Cherokees.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Thomas has also communicated the views of the Bureau
in other ways, as in the <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, vi. 90; vii.
65; <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, May, 1884, p. 396; 1887, p. 193;
July and Sept., 1888. In these papers, among other points,
he maintains that the defensive enclosures of northern
Ohio are due to the Iroquois-Huron tribes, and he accepts
the view of Peet and Latham, that the animal mounds
are more ancient than the simpler forms. Other investigators
have adopted, in some degree, this view. Horatio
Hale thinks the Cherokees of Iroquois origin, and that they
may have mingled with the moundbuilders. C. C. Baldwin
holds the Allegheni, Cherokees, and the moundbuilders to
be the same.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Prominent among those who have adopted this red-Indian
theory are Judge M. F. Force and Lucien Carr.
In 1874 Force published at Cincinnati a paper, which he
read before the literary club of that city; and in 1877 he
prepared a paper on the race of the moundbuilders, which
appears in French in the <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès des
Américanistes</i> (1877, i. p. 121), and in English, <i>To what
Race did the Moundbuilders belong</i> (Cincinnati, 1875).
He maintains that the race, which shows no differences from
the modern Indians, flourished till about 1,000 years ago,
and that some of them still survived in the Gulf States in
the sixteenth century, and that their development was about
on the plane of the Pueblos, higher than the Algonquins
and lower than the Aztecs.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Carr’s <i>Mounds of the Mississippi Valley historically
considered</i> makes part of the second volume of Shaler’s
<i>Kentucky Survey</i>, and was also issued separately (1883).
It is the most elaborate collation of the accounts of the
early travellers, and of others coming in contact with the
Indians at an early day, which has yet been made, and his
foot-notes are an ample bibliography of this aspect of the
subject. He holds that these early records prove that
nothing has been found in the mounds which was not
described in the early narratives as pertaining to the Indians
of the early contact. He aims also particularly to
show that these early Indians were agriculturists and sun-worshippers.
Brinton, reviewing the paper in the <i>American
Antiquarian</i> (1883, p. 68), holds that Carr goes too far,
and practises the arts of a special pleader. Brinton’s own
opinions seem somewhat to have changed. In the <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, Feb., 1866, p. 35, he considers the moundbuilders as
not advanced beyond the red Indians; and in the <i>American
Antiquarian</i> (1881), iv. 9, in inquiring into their probable
nationality, he thinks they were an ancient people who
were driven south and became the moundbuilding Chahta.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Other supporters of the red Indian view are Edmund
Andrews, in the <i>Wisconsin Acad. of Science</i>, iv. 126; P.
R. Hoy, in <i>Ibid.</i> vi.; O. T. Mason, in <i>Science</i>, iii. 658;

Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. ch. 10, etc., who holds that
“the moundbuilders were greatly more in advance of the
Indian hunter than behind the civilized Mexican;” and he
claims that the proof deduced from the Indian type of a
head discovered in a moundbuilder’s pipe (i. 366) is due
to a perverted drawing in Squier and Davis. Short, <i>No.
Amer. of Antiq.</i>, believed they were of the race later in
Anahuac. Gay, <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, i. ch. 2, believes in the
theory of a vanished race. In 1775 Adair thought the
works indicated a higher military energy than the modern
Indian showed.</p>

S. D. Peet, who edits this journal, has advanced in
one of his papers (vii. 82) that some of these earthworks
are Indian game drives and screens. (He also contributed
a classification of them to the <i>Congrès des Américanistes</i>,
1877, i. 103.) The paper by J. E. Stevenson (ii. 89), and
that by Horatio Hale on “Indian Migrations” (Jan.-April,
1883), are worth noting. The <i>Compte Rendu, Congrès
des Américanistes</i>, 1875 (i. 387), has Joly’s “Les Moundbuilders,

<p class="pfc4">The best known of the disputed relics are the following:
The largest mound in the Ohio Valley is that of the Grave
Creek, twelve miles below Wheeling, which was earliest described
by its owner, A. B. Tomlinson, in 1838. It is seventy
feet high and one thousand feet in circumference. (Cf.
Squier and Davis, Foster, MacLean, <i>Olden Time</i>, i. 232;
and account by P. P. Cherry&mdash;Wadsworth, 1877.) About
1838 a shaft was sunk by Tomlinson into it, and a rotunda
constructed in its centre out of an original cavity, as a showroom
for relics; and here, as taken from the mound, appeared
two years later what is known as the Grave Creek
stone, bearing an inscription of inscrutable characters.
The supposed relic soon attracted attention. H. R. Schoolcraft
pronounced its twenty-two characters such “as were
used by the Pelasgi,” in his <i>Observations respecting the
Grave creek mound, in Western Virginia; the antique
inscription discovered in its excavation; and the connected
evidence of the occupancy of the Mississippi valley during
the mound period, and prior to the discovery of America
by Columbus</i>, which appeared in the <i>Amer. Ethnological
Soc. Trans.</i>, i. 367 (N. Y., 1845). Cf. his <i>Indian Tribes</i>,
iv. 118, where he thinks it may be an “intrusive antiquity.”
The French savant Jomard published a <i>Note sur une
pierre gravée</i> (Paris, 1845, 1859), in which he thought it
Libyan. Lévy-Bing calls it Hebrew in <i>Congrès des Amér.</i>
(Nancy, i. 215). Other notices are by Moïse Schwab in
<i>Revue Archéologique</i>, Feb., 1857; José Perez in <i>Arch. de la
Soc. Amér. de France</i> (1865), ii. 173; and in America in the
<i>Amer. Pioneer</i>, ii. 197; Haven’s <i>Archæol. U. S.</i>, 133, and
<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April 29, 1863, pp. 13, 32; <i>Amer.
Antiquarian</i>, i. 139; Bancroft’s <i>Nat. Races</i>, v. 75.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Squier promptly questioned its authenticity (<i>Amer. Ethnol.
Soc. Trans.</i>, ii.; <i>Aborig. Mts.</i>, 168). Wilson laughed
at it (<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, ii. 100). Col. Whittlesey has done
more than any one to show its fraudulent character, and to
show how the cuts of it which have been made vary (<i>Western
Reserve, Hist. Soc. Tracts</i>), nos. 9 (1872), 33 (1876),
42 (1878), and 44 (1879.) Cf. on this side Short, p. 419;
and <i>Fourth Rept. Bur. Ethnol.</i>, 250. Its authenticity is,
however, maintained by MacLean (<i>Moundbuilders</i>, Cinn.,
1879), who summarizes the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">What is known as the Cincinnati tablet was found on
the site of that city in 1841 (<i>Amer. Pioneer</i>, ii. 195). Squier
accepted it as genuine, and thought it might be a printing-stone
for decorating hides (<i>Amer. Ethnol. Soc. Trans.</i>, ii.;
<i>Aborig. Mts.</i> (1847), p. 70). Whittlesey at first doubted it
(<i>West. Res. Hist. Tracts</i>, no. 9), but was later convinced of
its genuineness by Robert Clarke’s <i>Prehistoric Remains
found on the site of Cincinnati</i> (privately printed, Cinn.,
1876).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The so-called Berlin tablet was found in Ohio in 1876.
S. D. Peet believes it genuine (<i>Amer. Antiq.</i>, i. 73; vii.
222).</p>
<p class="pfc4">On the Rockford tablet, see Short, 44.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Davenport tablets, found by the Rev. J. Gass in a
mound near Davenport, in Jan., 1877, are described in the
<i>Davenport Acad. Proc.</i>, ii. 96, 132, 221, 349; iii. 155. Cf.
further in <i>Amer. Asso. Adv. Science Proc.</i> (April, 1877), by
R. J. Farquharson; <i>Congrès des Amér.</i> (1877, ii. 158, with
cut). The <i>American Antiquarian</i> records the controversy
over its genuineness. In vol. iv. 145, John Campbell
proposed a reading of the inscription. The suspicions are
set forth in vii. 373. Peet, in viii. 46, inclines to consider
it a fraud; and, p. 92, there is a defence. Short (pp. 38-39)
doubts. In the <i>Second Amer. Rept. Bur. of Ethnol.</i>, H.
W. Henshaw, on “Animal Carvings,” attacked its character.
(Cf. <i>Fourth Rept.</i>, p. 251.) A reply by C. E. Putnam
in vol. iv. of the <i>Davenport Acad. Proc.</i>, and issued
separately, is called <i>Vindication of the Authenticity of the
Elephant pipes and inscribed tablets in the Mus. of the
Davenport Acad.</i> (Davenport, Iowa, 1885). Cf. Cyrus
Thomas in <i>Science</i>, vi. 564; also Feb. 5, 1886, p. 119. The
question of the elephant pipes is included in the discussion,
some denying their genuineness. Cf. also <i>Amer. Antiq.</i>,
ii. 67; Short, 531; Dr. Max Uhle in <i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i>,
1887.</p>

It has been found convenient to follow an advancing
line of geographical succession, but the affiliations of the
peoples of the mounds seem to indicate that those dwelling
on both slopes and in the valleys of the Appalachian ranges
should be grouped together, as Thomas combines them in
his section on the mounds of the Appalachian District.

A few minor references may be given. The <i>Smithsonian
Reports</i> have papers by D. Trowbridge (1863); and
by F. H. Cushing on those of Orleans County (1874). W.
L. Stone held them to have been built by Egyptians, who
afterward went south (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Sept., 1878, ii.
533). Cf. <i>Ibid.</i> v. 35, and S. L. Frey in the <i>Amer. Naturalist</i>,
Oct., 1879. A small book, <i>Ancient Man in America</i>
(N. Y., 1880), by Frederic Larkin, takes issue with
Squier, and believes the builders were not the modern Indians.
He says he found in one of the N. Y. mounds, in
1854, a copper relic, with a mastodon, evidently in harness,
scratched upon it! H. G. Mercer’s <i>Lenape Stone</i> describes
a “gorget stone” dug up in Buck’s County, Penn.,
in 1872, which shows a carving representing a fight between
Indians and the hairy mammoth, which we are also
asked to accept as genuine. What is recognized as an
ancient burial mound of the Senecas is described at some
length in G. S. Conover’s <i>Reasons why the State should
acquire the famous burial mound of the Seneca Indians</i>
(1888).</p>

The best known of the ancient fortifications of this
region is that called Fort Ancient, about 42 miles from Cincinnati.
It was surveyed by Prof. Locke in 1843. Cf. L.

mounds in the Little Miami Valley, in Dr. C. L. Metz’s
<i>Prehistoric Monuments of the Little Miami Valley</i>, in the
<i>Journal of the Cincinnati Soc. of Nat. Hist.</i>, vol. i., Oct.,
1878. The explorations of Putnam and Metz are recorded
in the <i>Peab. Mus. Repts.</i>, xvii., xviii. (Marriott mound),
and xx. Cf. Putnam’s lecture in <i>Mag. West. History</i>,
Jan., 1888. There are explorations at Madisonville noticed
in the <i>Journal of the Cinn. Soc. Nat. Hist.</i>, Apr., 1880.
Others in this region are recorded in L. B. Welch and J.
M. Richardson’s <i>Prehistoric relics found near Wilmington</i>
(Sparks mound), and by F. W. Langdon in the appendix
of Short.</p>

None of the bones of extinct animals have been found
in the mounds; nor has the buffalo, long a ranger of the
Mississippi Valley, been identified in the shapes of the
mounds. (Cf. Peet on the identification of animal mounds
in <i>Amer. Antiq.</i>, vi. 176.) Peet holds they followed the
mastodon period (<i>Ibid.</i> ix. 67). The elephant mound, so
called, has been often shown in cuts. (Cf. <i>Smithsonian
Rept.</i>, 1877, accompanying a paper by J. Warner, and Powell’s
<i>Second Rept. Bur. of Eth.</i>, 153.) Henshaw here discredits
the idea of its being intended for an elephant. The
evidence of elephant pipes is thought uncertain. Cf. article
on mound pipes by Barber in <i>Amer. Naturalist</i>, April,
1882.</p>

The aboriginal remains of Tennessee have successively
been treated in John Haywood’s <i>History of Tennessee</i>
(Nashville, 1823); by Gerard Troost in <i>Amer. Ethnol.
Soc. Trans.</i> (1845), i. 335; by Joseph Jones in <i>Smithsonian
Contributions</i>, xx. (1876), who connected those who erected
the works, through the Natchez Indians, with the Nahuas.
Edward O. Dunning had described some of the Tennessee
relics in the <i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i>, iii., iv., and v.; but
Putnam in no. xi. (1878) gave the results of his opening of
the stone graves, with his explorations of the sites of the
villages of the people, and described their implements, nothing
of which, as he said, showed contact with Europeans.
Cyrus Thomas deems these remains the works of the Indian
race (<i>Amer. Antiq.</i>, vii. 129; viii. 162). The <i>Smithsonian
Repts.</i> have had various papers on the Tennessee antiquities:
I. Dille (1862); A. F. Danilsen (1863); M. C. Read (1867);
E. A. Dayton, E. O. Dunning, E. M. Grant, and J. P.
Stelle (1870); Rev. Joshua Hall, A. E. Law, and D. F.
Wright (1874); and others (in 1877).</p>

on Creeks and Cherokees; and on the great mound in
the Etowah Valley, <i>Amer. Asso. Adv. Sci.</i> (1871). Thomas
(<i>Fifth Rept. Bur. Ethnol.</i>) supposes the Etowah mound to
be the one with a roadway described by Garcilasso de la
Vega as being on De Soto’s route. Thomas describes other
mounds of this group, giving cuts of the incised copper
plates found in them, which he holds to be of European
make. This forces him to the conclusion that the larger
mound was built before De Soto’s incursion and the others
later; and as they differ from those in Carolina, he determines
they were not built by the Cherokees.</p>

The first session of the International Congress of Prehistoric
[Anthropology and] Archæology was held at Neuchâtel,
and its proceedings were printed in the <i>Materiaux
pour l’histoire de l’homme</i>. The second session was at
Paris; the third at Norwich, England; the fourth at
Copenhagen; and there have been others of later years.
Cf. A. de Quatrefages’ <i>Rapport sur le progrès de l’anthropologie</i>
(Paris, 1868). Quatrefages himself is one of the
most distinguished of the French school, and deserves as
much as any to rank as the founder of the present French
school of anthropologists. Cf. his <i>Hommes fossiles et
hommes sauvages</i> (1884). The English reader can most
easily get possessed of his view, conservative in some respects,
in Eliza A. Youman’s English version of his most
popular book, <i>Nat. Hist. of Man</i> (N. Y., 1875).</p>

There is some question if the early Americans ever carried
on the heavier parts of the quarrying arts, as for building-stones.
Cf. Morgan’s <i>Houses and House Life</i>, 274.
They did quarry soap-stone (Elmer R. Reynolds, Schumacher
and Putnam, in <i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i>, xii.) and
mica (<i>Smithsonian Report</i>, 1879, by W. Gesner; C. D.
Smith in <i>Ibid.</i> 1876; Dr. Brinton in <i>Proc. Numism. and
Antiq. Soc. of Philad.</i>, 1878, p. 18). That they quarried
pipe-stone is also well known, and the famous red pipe-stone
quarry, lying between the Missouri and Minnesota
rivers, was under the protection of the Great Spirit, so that
tribes at war with one another are said to have buried their
hatchets as they approached it. Wilson, in the last chapter
of the first volume of his <i>Prehistoric man</i>, examines this
pipe-carving and tells the story of this famous quarry. He
refers to the tobacco mortars of the Peruvians in which they
ground the dry leaf; and to the pipes of the mounds in
which it was smoked. Cf. J. F. Nadaillac’s <i>Les pipes et
le tabac</i> (Paris, 1885), taken from the <i>Materiaux pour
l’histoire primitive de l’homme</i> (ii. for 1885); and Lucien
de Rosny on “Le tabac et ses accessoires parmi les indigènes
de l’Amérique,” in <i>Mémoires sur l’Archéologie
Américaine</i>, 1865, of the Soc. d’Ethnographie.</p>

It should be remembered that the recognition of the
Flint-folk as occupying a distinct stage of development is
a modern notion. For a century and a half after European
museums began to gather stone implements they were
reputed relics of Celtic art. Treatment of American art
necessarily makes part of the works of Squier and Davis;
Schoolcraft; Foster’s <i>Prehistoric Races</i>, ch. 6; Lubbock’s
<i>Prehistoric Times;</i> Joly’s <i>Man before Metals</i>. Cf. references
in <i>Poole’s Index</i> under “Stone Age” and “Stone
Implements.”</p>

Rau is an authority on stone implements. See further
his paper on stone implements in the <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>,
1872; one on drilling stone without metal in <i>Ibid.</i> 1868;
and one on cup-shaped and other lapidarian sculpture in
the <i>Contributions to No. Amer. Ethnology</i>, vol. v. (Powell’s
<i>Rocky Mountain Survey</i>, 1882). These carved, cup-like
cavities in rocks are also discussed in Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric
Man</i>, vol. i. ch. 3, where it is held that they were
formed by the grinding process in shaping the rounded end
of tools. H. W. Henshaw in the <i>Amer. Jour. of Archæology</i>
(i. 105) discusses another enigma in the stone relics,
called sinkers or plummets. Foster (<i>Prehist. Races</i>, 230)
believes they were used as weights to keep the thread taut
in weaving.</p>

Cf. G. Crook “on the Indian method of making arrow-heads”
in the <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1871, and C. C. Jones,
Jr., on “the primitive manufacture of spear and arrowpoints
along the Savannah River” in <i>Ibid.</i> 1879. A paper
by Sellers in a later report is of importance. Cf. Stevens’
<i>Flint Chips</i>, pp. 75-85, and Schumacher in <i>Smithsonian
Report</i>, 1873. True flint was not often, if ever, used in America, but
rather chert or hornstone, and quartz, though implements
are found of jasper, chalcedony, obsidian, quartzite, and
argillite. Cf. Rau on the stock in trade of an aboriginal
lapidary in <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i> (1877); and Rosny’s “Recherches
sur les masques, le jade et l’industrie lapidaire
chez les indigènes de l’Amérique” in <i>Arch. de la Soc.
Amér. de France</i>, n. s., vol. i. Jade or jadite implements
and ornaments have been found in Central America and
Mexico, and others resembling them in northwestern America;
but it is not yet clear that the unworked material, such
as is used in the middle America specimens, is found in
America <i>in situ</i>. Upon the solution of this last problem
will depend the value of these implements when found in
America as bearing upon questions of Asiatic intercourse.
Cf. Dr. A. B. Meyer in the <i>Amer. Anthropologist</i> (vol. i.,

Wilson (<i>Prehistoric Man</i>, i. 200) points out that philology
confirms it, the word for copper meaning “yellow
stone.” On the question of their melting metal see letter of
Prof. F. W. Putnam in <i>Kansas City Rev. of Science</i>, Dec.
1881; Wilson (i. 361); Foster’s <i>Prehistoric Races</i>, 293.</p>

Wilson (i. 209, 227) thinks the arboreal and other
evidences carry the time when these mines were worked
back, at latest, to a period corresponding to Europe’s
mediæval era. The earliest modern references to copper
in this region are in Sagard in 1632 (Haven, p. 127) and in
the <i>Jesuit Relation</i> of Allouez in 1666-67. Alexander
Henry (<i>Travels and Adventures in Canada</i>) in 1765 is
the earliest English explorer to mention it. Wilson holds
to the belief that the present race of red Indians had no
knowledge of these mining practices, but that they knew
simply chance masses or exposed lodes. Wilson (i. 362)
also gives reasons for supposing that the Lake Superior
mines may have been a common meeting ground for all
races of the continent.</p>

Of the Lake Superior mines, the earliest intelligent
account we have is in C. T. Jackson’s <i>Geological Report
to the U. S. Gov’t</i>, 1849; but a more extended and connected
account appeared the next year in the <i>Report on
the Geology of Lake Superior</i> (Washington, 1850), by
J. W. Foster and J. D. Whitney, which is substantially
reproduced in Foster’s <i>Prehistoric Races</i> (1873), ch. 7.
Meanwhile, Col. Charles Whittlesey had published in vol.
xiii. of the <i>Smithsonian Contributions</i> his <i>Ancient Mining
on the shores of Lake Superior</i> (Washington, 1863,
with a map), which is on the whole the best account,
to be supplemented by his paper in the <i>Memoirs</i> of the
Boston Society of Natural History. Jacob Houghton
supplied a description of the “ancient copper mines of
Lake Superior” to Swineford’s <i>History and Review of
the mineral resources of Lake Superior</i> (Marquette, 1876).

It has been a question whether the palæolithic man
talked, and it has been asserted and denied, from the character
of certain inferior maxillary bones found in caves, that
he had the power of articulate speech. Dr. Brinton has
recently, from an examination of the lowest stocks of linguistic
utterances now known, endeavored to set forth “a
somewhat correct conception of what was the character of
the rudimentary utterances of the race.” Cf. Brinton,
<i>Language of the Palæolithic Man</i>, Philadelphia, 1888;
Mortillet, <i>La préhistorique Antiquité de l’Homme</i> (Paris,
1883); H. Steinthal, <i>Der Ursprung der Sprache</i> (Berlin,
1888). Horatio Hale, on “The origin of languages and
the antiquity of speaking man,” in the <i>Am. Assoc. Adv.
Sci. Proc</i>., xxxv. 279, cites the views of some physiologists
to show that the pre-glacial man could not talk, because
there are only rudimentary signs of the presence of important
vocal muscles to be discovered in the most ancient
jaw-bones which have been found. Rau inferred
that the totally diverse character, as he thought, of the
American tongues indicated strongly that the earliest man
could not articulate (<i>Contrib. to N. A. Ethnology</i>, v. 92).

A prominent feature is the process of uniting words
lengthwise, so to speak, which gives a single utterance the
import of a sentence. This characteristic of the American
languages has been called polysynthetic, incorporative,
holophrastic, aggregative, and agglutinative. H. H. Bancroft
instances the word for letter-postage in Aztec as being
“Amatlacuilolitquitcatlaxtlahuilli,” which really signifies
by its component parts, “payment received for carrying a
paper on which something is written.” Cf. Brinton’s <i>On
polysynthesism and incorporation as characteristic of
American languages</i> (Philad., 1885).</p>

evidences of the antiquity of man were understood, and
the remoteness referred to was a period near the great dispersion
of Babel.</p>

The interlinking method of communication between
tribes of different languages is what is called sign or gesture
language, and the study of it shows that in much the same
forms it is spread over the continent. It has been specially
studied by Col. Garrick Mallery. Cf. his papers in the
<i>Amer. Antiquarian</i>, ii. 218; <i>Proc. Amer. Asso. Adv.
Science</i>, Saratoga meeting, 1880; and at length in the
<i>First Annual Rept. Bur. of Ethnology</i> (1881). He notes
his sources of information on pp. 395, 401. He had earlier
printed under the Bureau’s sanction his <i>Introduction to
the Study of Sign Language</i> (Washington, 1880). The
subject is again considered in the <i>Third Rept.</i> of the Bureau,
p. xxvi. Cf. also W. P. Clark’s <i>Indian Sign-language,
with Explanatory Notes</i> (Philad., 1885). Morgan
(<i>Systems of Consanguinity</i>, 227) expresses the opinion that
it has the germinal principle “from which came, first, the
pictographs of the northern Indians and of the Aztecs;
and, secondly, as its ultimate development, the ideographic
and possibly the hieroglyphic language of the Palenqué and
Copan monuments.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">In addition to languages and dialects, we have a whole
body of jargons, a conventional mixture of tongues, adduced
by continued intercourse of peoples speaking different
languages. They grew up very early, where the French
came in contact with the aborigines, and Father Le Jeune
mentions one in 1633 (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, v. 345). The Chinook
jargon, for instance, was, if not invented, at least developed
by the Hudson Bay Company’s servants, out of French,
English, and several Indian tongues (whose share predominates),
to facilitate their trade with the natives, and does not
contain, at an outside limit, more than 400 or 500 words.
There is some reason to believe that the Indian portion of
this jargon is older, however, than the English contact
(Bancroft, iii. 632-3; Gibbs’s <i>Chinook Dictionary</i>; Horatio
Hale in Wilkes’ <i>U. S. Explor. Exped.</i>).</p>

We know little of what Jefferson might have accomplished,
for his manuscripts were burned in 1801 (Schoolcraft’s
<i>Ind. Tribes</i>, ii. 356). As early as 1804 the U. S.
War Department issued a list of words, for which its agents
should get in different tribes the equivalent words. Gallatin
used these results. Different lists of test words have
been often used since. George Gibbs had a list. The Bureau
of Ethnology has a list.</p>

Among other workers in the northern philology may be
named Schoolcraft in his <i>Indian Tribes</i> (ii. and iii. 340),
who makes no advance upon Gallatin; W. W. Turner in
the <i>Smithsonian Report</i>, vi.; R. S. Riggs adds a Dacota
bibliography to his <i>Grammar and Dictionary of the Dacota
language</i> (Washington, Smiths. Inst., 1852); George
Gibbs in the <i>Smithsonian Repts.</i> for 1865 and 1870, and as
collaborator in other studies, of which record is made in
J. A. Stevens’ memoir of Gibbs, first printed in the <i>N. Y.
Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, and then in the <i>Smithsonian Report</i> for
1873; F. W. Hayden’s <i>Contributions to the ethnography
and philology of the Indian tribes of the Missouri Valley</i>
(Philad., 1862), being vol. xiii. of the <i>Trans. Amer. Philosophical
Soc.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">A contemporary of Gallatin, but a man sorely harassed,
as others see him, with eccentricities and unstableness of
head, was C. F. Rafinesque, who had nevertheless a certain
tendency to acute observation, which prevents his books
from becoming wholly worthless. His first publication was
an introduction to Marshall’s <i>History of Kentucky</i>, which
he printed separately as <i>Ancient History, or Annals of
Kentucky, with a survey of the ancient monuments of
North America, and a tabular view of the principal languages
and primitive nations of the whole earth</i> (Frankfort,
Ky., 1824). In this he makes a comparison of four
principal words from fourteen Indian tongues with thirty-four
primitive languages of the old world. In 1836 he
printed at Philadelphia <i>The American Nations, or outlines
of their general history, ancient and modern, including the
whole history of the earth and mankind in the western
hemisphere; the philosophy of American history; the annals,
traditions, civilization, languages, etc., of all American
nations, tribes, empires and states</i> (in two volumes).</p>

The languages covered are: Dakota, Chibcha, Nahuatl,
Kechua, Quiché, Maya, Montagnais, Chippeway,
Algonquin, Cri, Iroquois, Hidatsa, Chacta, Caraïbe, Kiriri,
Guarani. Adam has been one of the leading spirits in the
Congrès des Américanistes. There was published in 1882,
as a part of the <i>Bibliothèque linguistique Américaine, a
Grammaire et Vocabulaire de la langue taensa, avec
textes traduits et commentés par F. D. Haumonté, Parisot,
L. Adam</i>. It was printed from a manuscript said to
have been discovered in 1872, in the library of Mons. Haumonté.
Dr. Brinton, finding, as he claimed, that Adam
had been imposed upon, printed in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>,
March, 1885, “The Tænsa Grammar and Dictionary,
a Deception Exposed,” the points of which were
epitomized by Professor H. W. Haynes in the <i>American
Antiquarian Society Proceedings</i> (April, 1885), and Adam
answered in <i>Le Tænsa, a-t-il été forgé de toutes pièces</i>
(Paris, 1885).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The languages of the southern and southwestern United
States have been particularly studied by Albert S. Gatschet,
among whose publications may be named <i>Zwölf Sprachen
aus dem Südwesten Nord Amerikas</i> (Weimar, 1877); <i>The
Timucua language</i> of Florida (Philad., 1878, 1880); <i>The
Chumeto language</i> of California (Philad., 1882); <i>Der
Yuma Sprachstamm</i> of Arizona and the neighboring regions
(Berlin, 1877, 1883); <i>Wortverzeichniss eines Viti-Dialectes</i>
(Berlin, 1882); <i>The Shetimasha Indians of St.
Mary’s Parish, Louisiana</i> (Washington, 1883); but his
most important contribution is the linguistic, historic, and
ethnographic introduction to his <i>Migration Legend of the
Creek Indians</i> (Philad., 1884), in which he has surveyed
the whole compass of the southern Indians. The extent
of Mr. Gatschet’s studies will appear from Pilling’s <i>Proof-sheets</i>,
pp. 285-292, 955.</p>

He cites (iii. 725-26) many opinions; and quotes Sahagún
as saying that the Apalaches were Nahuas and spoke
the Mexican tongue (<i>Ibid</i>. iii. 727). Is this any evidence
of the Floridian immigration?</p>

A considerable body of literature in this language has
come down to us. Bancroft (iii. 728) enumerates a number
of the principal religious manuals, etc. Icazbalceta in the
first volume of his <i>Bibliografia Mexicana</i> (Mexico, 1886),
in cataloguing the books issued in Mexico before 1600, includes
all that were printed in the native tongue. Brinton
gives some account of such native authors in his <i>Aboriginal
American authors and their productions, especially those
in the native languages. A chapter in the history of literature</i>
(Philad., 1883). Cf. his paper in the <i>Congrès des
Amér.</i>, Copenhagen, 1883, p. 54. Bancroft (iii. 730) gives
some citations as to its literary value. Brinton has illustrated
this quality in some of his lesser monographs, as in
his <i>Ancient Nahuatl Poetry</i> (Philad., 1887); and in his
<i>Study of the Nahuatl language</i> (1886), in which he gives
specimens and enumerates the dictionaries and texts. He
says there are more than a hundred authors in it (<i>Amer.
Antiquarian</i>, viii. 22). Icazbalceta has collected many
Nahua MSS., and his brother-in-law, Francisco Pimentel,
has used them in his <i>Cuadro descriptivo y comparativo
de las Lenguas indigenas de México</i> (1862), of which there
is a German translation by Isidor Epstein (N. Y., 1877).
This is based on a second augmented edition (Mexico,
1874-75), in which the tongues of northern Mexico are
better represented, and a general classification of the languages
is added. Pimentel (i. 154) asserts that it is a mistake
to suppose that the Chichimecs spoke Nahua. Cf.,
however, Bancroft (iii. 724) and Short, 255, 480. Pimentel’s
opinions are weighty, and follow in this respect those
of Orozco y Berra, Sahagún, Ixtlilxochitl; but later, Veytia
had maintained the reverse.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Lucien Adam includes the Nahua in his <i>Etudes sur six
langues Américaines</i> (Paris, 1878). Aubin wrote “Sur
la langue Méxicaine et la philologie Américaine” in the
<i>Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France</i>, n. s., vol. i. Brasseur
contributed various articles on Mexican philology to
the <i>Revue Orientale et Américaine</i>. Dr. C. Hermann
Berendt formed an <i>Analytical Alphabet for the Mexican
and Central America languages</i> (N. Y., 1869). Buschmann
has a study in the <i>Mémoirs de l’Académie de Berlin</i>,
and separately, <i>Ueber die Astekischen Ortsnamen</i> (Berlin,
1853). Henri de Charencey in his <i>Mélanges de Philologie</i>
(Paris, 1883) has a paper “Sur quelques familles de langues
du Méxique.” V. A. Malte-Brun gave in the <i>Compte
Rendu, Cong. des Américanistes</i>, 1877 (vol. ii. p. 10), a paper
“La distribution ethnographique des nations et des langues
au Méxique.” Reference has been made elsewhere to the
important publication of Manuel Orozco y Berra, <i>Geografia
de las lenguas y carta etnográfica de México, precedidos
de un ensayo de classificacion de las mismas lenguas y de
apuntes para las inmigraciones de las tribus</i> (Mexico, 1864).
The work is said to be the fruit of twelve years’ constant
study, and to have been based in some part on MSS. belonging
to Icazbalceta, dating back to the latter part of the
sixteenth century (enumerated in <i>Peab. Mus. Repts.</i>, ii. 559).
There is some adverse criticism. Peschel (<i>Races of Men</i>,
438) thinks the linguistic map of Mexico in Orozco y Berra’s
work the only good feature in the book, since the author
spreads old errors anew in consequence of his unacquaintance
with Buschmann’s researches. A series of linguistic
monographic essays on the Aztec names of places is embraced
in Dr. Antonio Peñafiel’s <i>Nombres Geografico de
Mexico. Catalogo alfabetico de los nombres de lugar pertenecientes
al idioma “Nahuatl” estudio jeroglifico de la
matricula de los tributos del codice Mendocino</i> (Mexico,
1885). In the <i>Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France</i>, n. s.,

<p class="pfc4">The affiliation of the Aztec with the Pueblo stocks is
traced by Bancroft, iii. 665, who follows out the diversities
of those stocks (pp. 671, 681). Cf. for various views Morgan’s
<i>Systems of Consanguinity</i>, 260; Buschmann’s <i>Die
Völker und Sprachen Neu Mexico’s</i>, and <i>First Rept. Bur.
of Ethnology</i>, p. xxxi.</p>

Some authorities give fourteen dialects of the Maya.
Cf. the table in Bancroft, iii. 562, etc., and the statements
in Garcia y Cubas, translated by Geo. F. Henderson as <i>The
Republic of Mexico</i>. It is still spoken in the greatest
purity about the Balize, as is commonly said; but Le Plongeon
goes somewhat inland and says he found it “in all its
pristine purity” in the neighborhood of Lake Peten. Le
Plongeon, with that extravagance which has in the end deprived
him of the sympathy and encouragement due to his
noteworthy labors, says, “One third of this Maya tongue
is pure Greek,” following Brasseur in one of his vagaries,
who thought he found in 15,000 Maya vocables at least 7,000
that bore a striking resemblance to the language of Homer.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1893_1893" id="Footnote_1893_1893"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1893_1893"><span class="label">[1893]</span></a></span>
The bibliographies will add to this enumeration. The
<i>Pinart Catalogue</i> (pp. 98-100) gives a partial list. Only
some of the more important monographs upon features of
the Maya language can be mentioned: Father Pedro Beltran
de Santa Rosa’s <i>Arte del idioma Maya</i> (Mexico,
1746) was so rare that Brasseur did not secure it, but Leclerc
catalogues it (no. 2,280), as well as the reprint (Merida,
1859) edited by José D. Espinosa. There is a study of the
Maya tongues included in a paper printed first by Carl
Hermann Berendt in the <i>Journal of the Amer. Geog. Soc.</i>
(viii. 132, for 1876), which was later issued separately as <i>Remarks
on the centres of ancient civilization in Central
America and their geographical distribution</i> (N. Y., 1876).
It is accompanied by a map. (Cf. also his “Explorations in
Central America” in the <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1867.) Brasseur
included in his <i>Manuscrit Troano</i> (Paris, 1869-70), and
later published separately, a <i>Dictionnaire, Grammaire et
Chrestomathie de la langue Maya</i> (Paris, 1872); the dictionary
containing 10,000 words, the grammar being a translation
from Father Gabriel de Saint Bonaventure, while
the chrestomathy was a gathering of specimens ancient and
modern, of the language. Brasseur, in his mutable way,
found in the first season of his studies the Greek, Latin,
English, German, Scandinavian, not to name others, to
have correspondences with the Maya, and ended in deriving
them from that tongue as the primitive language. (Cf.
Short, 476.) Dr. Brinton has a paper on <i>The Ancient
Phonetic Alphabet of Yucatan</i> (N. Y., 1870), and he read
at the Buffalo meeting (1886) of the Amer. Assoc. for the
Advancement of Science a paper on the phonetic element
of the graphic system of the Mayas, etc., which is printed
in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, viii. 347. In the introduction
of his <i>Maya Chronicles</i> (Philad., 1882) he examines
the language and literature of the Mayas. He refers to a
“Disertacion sobre la historia de la lengua Maya o Yucateca”
by Crescencio Carrello y Ancona in the <i>Revista de
Merida</i>, 1870. Charencey has printed various special papers,
like a <i>Fragment de Chrestomathie de la langue
Maya antique</i> (Paris, 1875) from the <i>Revue de Philologie
et d’Ethnographie</i>, and a paper read before the Copenhagen
meeting of the Congrès des Américanistes (<i>Compte Rendu</i>,
p. 379), “De la formation des mots en lengua Maya.”
Landa’s <i>Relation</i> as published by Brasseur (Paris, 1864) is
of course a leading source.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the Quiché branch of the Maya we know most from
Brasseur’s <i>Popul Vuh</i> and from his <i>Gramatica de la
lengua Quiché</i> (Paris, 1862), in the appendix of which he
printed the <i>Rabinal Achi</i>, a drama in the Quiché tongue.
Father Ildefonso José Flores, a native of the country, was
professor of the Cakchiquel language in the university of
Guatemala in the last century, and published a <i>Arte de la
lengua metropolitana del Reyno Cakchiquel</i> (Guatemala,
1753), which was unknown to later scholars, till Brasseur
discovered a copy in 1856 (Leclerc, no. 2,270). The literature
of the Cakchiquel dialect is examined in the introduction
to Brinton’s <i>Grammar of the Cakchiquel language</i>
(Philad., 1884), edited for the American Philosophical Society.
Cf. Brinton’s little <i>treatise On the language and
ethnologic position of the Xinca Indians of Guatemala</i>
(Philadelphia, 1884); his <i>So-called Alaguilac language of
Guatemala</i> in the <i>Proc. Am. Philosoph. Soc.</i>, 1887, p. 366;
and Otto Stoll’s <i>Zur Ethnographie der Republik Guatemala</i>
(Zurich, 1884).</p>
<p class="pfc4">We owe to Brinton, also, a few discussions of the Nicaragua
tongues, both in their Maya and Aztec relations. He
has discussed the local dialect of this region in the introduction
of <i>The Güegüence; a comedy ballet in the Nahuatl-Spanish
dialect of Nicaragua</i> (Philadelphia, 1883), and in
his <i>Notes on the Mangue, an extinct dialect formerly
spoken in Nicaragua</i> (Philadelphia, 1886).</p>

Notwithstanding this commonness of origin, if such be
the case, there is a striking truth in what Max Müller says:
“The thoughts of primitive humanity were not only different
from our thoughts, but different also from what we
think their thoughts ought to have been.”</p>

Bancroft (iii. 136) says: “It does not appear, notwithstanding
Mr. Squier’s assertion to the contrary, that the
serpent was actually worshipped either in Yucatan or
Mexico.” Cf. Brinton’s <i>Myths</i>, ch. 4; Chas. S. Wake’s
<i>Serpent Worship</i> (London, 1888); and J. G. Bourke’s
<i>Snake-dance of the Moquis of Arizona; being a narrative
of a journey from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the villages
of the Moqui Indians of Arizona, with a description
of the manners and customs of this peculiar people, to
which is added a brief dissertation upon serpent-worship
in general, with an account of the tablet dance of the
Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico, etc.</i> (London,
1884).</p>

Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, etc., 141) declares sun-worship, which
some investigators have made the base of all primitive
religions, to be but a “short and easy method with mythology,”
and that “no one key can open all the arcana of
symbolism.” He refers to D’Orbigny (<i>L’Homme Américain</i>),
Müller (<i>Amer. Urreligionen</i>), and Squier (<i>Serpent
Symbol</i>) as supporting the opposing view. We may find
like supporters of the sun as a central idea in Schoolcraft,
Tylor, Brasseur. Cf. Bancroft’s <i>Native Races</i> (iii. 114) in
opposition to Brinton.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1899_1899" id="Footnote_1899_1899"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1899_1899"><span class="label">[1899]</span></a></span>
This monotheism is denied by Brinton (<i>Myths of the
New World</i>, 52). “Of monotheism, either as displayed in
the one personal definite God of the Semitic races, or in
the dim pantheistic sense of the Brahmins, there was not a
single instance on the American continent,”&mdash;the Iroquois
“Neu” and “Hawaneu,” which, as Brinton says, have deceived
Morgan and others, being but the French “Dieu”
and “Le bon Dieu” rendered in Indian pronunciation
(<i>Myths of the New World</i>, p. 53). The aborigines instituted,
however, in two instances, the worship of an immaterial
god, one among the Quichuas of Peru and another at
Tezcuco (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 55).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bandelier (<i>Archæol. Tour</i>, 185), examining the <i>Hist. de
los Méxicanos por sus Pinturas</i> (<i>Anales del Museo</i>, ii. 86),
Motolinía, Gómara, Sahagún, Tobar, and Durán, finds no
trace of monotheism till we come to Acosta. Torquemada
speaks of supreme <i>gods</i>; and Bandelier thinks that Ixtlilxochitl,
in conveying the idea of a single god, evidently distorts
and disfigures Torquemada.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bancroft (iii. 198) accords honesty to Ixtlilxochitl’s account
of the religion of the Tezcucan ruler Nezahualcoyotl,
as reaching the heights of Mexican monotheistic conception,
because he thinks his descendants, if he had fabled,
would never have ended his description with so pagan a
statement as that which makes the Tezcucan recognize the
sun as his father and the earth as his mother.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Max Müller tells us that we should distinguish between
monotheism and henotheism, which is the temporary preeminence
of one god over the host of gods, and which was
as near monotheism as the American aborigines came.</p>

He also masses the evidence which shows, as he thinks,
that “on Catholic missions has followed the debasement,
and on Protestant missions the destruction, of the Indian
race.” <i>Amer. Hero-Myths</i>, pp. 206, 238.</p>

Unfortunately, Brinton enforces this view and others
with a degree of confidence that does not help him to convince
the cautious reader, as when he speaks of the opinions
of those who disagree with him as “having served long
enough as the last refuge of ignorance” (<i>Amer. Hero-Myths</i>,
145).</p>

The whole question of comparative mythology involves
in its broad aspects the subject of American myths. The
literature of this general kind is large, but reference may be
made to Girard de Rialle’s <i>La Mythologie Comparée</i> (Paris,
1878); for the idea of God, Dawson’s <i>Fossil Men</i>, ch. 9 and
10; Lubbock’s <i>Origin of Civilization</i>, ch. 4, 5, 6; J. P.
Lesley’s <i>Man’s origin and destiny</i>, ch. 10; and for the
geographical distribution of myths, Tylor’s <i>Early Hist. of
Mankind</i>, ch. 12; Max Müller’s <i>Chips</i>, vol. ii.; and in a
general way, Brinton’s <i>Religious sentiment, its source and
aim</i> (N. Y., 1876). Reference may also be made to Joly’s
<i>Man before Metals</i>, ch. 7; Dabry de Thiersant’s <i>Origine
des indiens</i> (Paris, 1883); and G. Brühl’s <i>Culturvölker Alt-Amerikas</i>
(Cincinnati, 1876-78), ch. 10 and 19.
Brinton (<i>Myths</i>, 210) tracks the Deluge myth among the
Indians, and Bancroft gives many instances of it (<i>Native
Races</i>, v., index). Brinton thinks a paper by Charencey,
“Le Déluge d’après les traditions indiennes de l’Amérique
du Nord,” in the <i>Revue Américaine</i>, a help for its extracts,
but complains of its uncritical spirit.</p>
<p class="pfc4">We find sufficient data of the aboriginal belief in the
future life both in Bancroft’s final chapter (vol. iii. part i.)
and in Brinton’s <i>Myths</i>, ch. 9. Brinton delivered an address
on the “Journey of the soul,” which is printed in the <i>Proceedings</i>
(Jan., 1883) of the Numismatic and Antiquarian
Society of Philadelphia.</p>

In studying the mythology of these tribes we must
depend mainly on confined monographs. Mrs. E. A. Smith
treats the myths of the Iroquois in the <i>Second Annual
Rept. Bureau of Ethnology</i>. Charles Godfrey Leland has
covered <i>The Algonquin legends of New England; or,
myths and folk-lore of the Micmac, Passamaquoddy, and
Penobscot tribes</i> (Boston, 1884). Brinton has a book on
<i>The Lenâpé and their legends</i> (Philad., 1885); and one may
refer to the <i>Life and Journals of David Brainard</i>. S. D.
Peet has a paper on “The religious beliefs and traditions
of the aborigines of North America” in the <i>Journal of the
Victoria Institute</i> (London, 1888, vol. xxi. 229); one on
“Animal worship and Sun worship in the east and west compared”
in the <i>American Antiquarian</i>, Mar., 1888; and a
paper on the religion of the moundbuilders in <i>Ibid.</i> vi. 393.
The <i>Dahcotah, or life and legends of the Sioux around
Fort Snelling</i> (N. Y., 1849) of Mrs. Mary Eastman has
been a serviceable book. S. R. Riggs covers the mythology
of the Dakotas in the <i>Amer. Antiquarian</i> (v. 147), and in
this periodical will be found various studies concerning other
tribes.</p>

There is more or less of original importance on the
Aztec myths in Alfredo Chavero’s “La Piedra del Sol,”
likewise in the <i>Anales</i> (vol. i.). Cf. also the “Ritos Antiguos,
sacrificios e idolatrias de los indios de la Nueva
España,” as printed in the <i>Coleccion de doc. ined. para
la hist. de España</i> (liii. 300).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bancroft (vol. iii. ch. 6-10), who is the best source for
reference, gives also the best compassed survey of the entire
field; but among writers in English he may be supplemented
by Prescott (i. ch. 3, introd.); Helps in his <i>Spanish
Conquest</i> (vol. ii.); Tylor’s <i>Primitive Culture</i>; Albert
Réville’s <i>Lectures on the origin and growth of religion as
illustrated by the native religions of Mexico and Peru</i>,
translated by P. H. Wicksteed (London, 1884, being the
Hibbert lectures for 1884); on the analogies of the Mexican
belief, a condensed statement in Short’s <i>No. America of
Antiq.</i>, 459; a popular paper in <i>The Galaxy</i>, May, 1876.
Bandelier intended a fourth paper to be added to the three
printed in the <i>Peabody Mus. Repts.</i> (vol. ii.), namely, one on
“The Creeds and Beliefs of the Ancient Mexicans,” which
has never, I think, been printed.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the French, we may refer to Ternaux-Compans’
<i>Essai sur la théogonie Méxicaine</i> (Paris, 1840) and the
works of Brasseur. Klemm’s <i>Cultur-Geschichte</i> and
Müller’s <i>Urreligionen</i> will mainly cover the German
views. Of the Mexican writers, it may be worth while to
name J. M. Melgar’s <i>Examen comparativa entre los signos
simbolicos de las Teogonias y Cosmogonias antiguas y
los que existen en los manuscritos Méxicanos</i> (Vera Cruz,
1872).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The readiest description of their priesthood and festivals
will be found in Bancroft (ii. 201, 303, with references).
Tenochtitlan is said to have had 2,000 sacred buildings, and
Torquemada says there were 80,000 throughout Mexico;
while Clavigero says that a million priests attended upon
them. Bancroft (iii. ch. 10) describes this service. There
is a chance in all this of much exaggeration.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The history of human sacrifice as a part of this service is
the subject of disagreement among the earlier as well as
with the later writers. Bancroft (iii. 413, 442) gives some
leading references. Cf. Prescott (i. 77) and Nadaillac (p.
296). Las Casas in his general defence of the natives
places the number of sacrifices very low. Zumárraga says
there were 20,000 a year. The Aztecs, if not originating
the practice, as is disputed by some, certainly made much
use of it.</p>

Thomas with Quetzalcoatl. Cf. Bancroft, iii. 456.</p>

Müller agrees with Ixtlilxochitl that Quetzalcoatl and
Huemac were one and the same, and that Ternaux erred in
supposing them respectively Olmec and Toltec deities. Cf.

The documentary history, by W. J. Rhees, of the
Smithsonian Institution, forms vol. xvii. of its <i>Miscellaneous
Collections</i>. Cf. J. Henry on its organization in the <i>Proceedings</i>
of the Amer. Asso. for the Adv. of Science, vol. i.
A <i>Catalogue of the publications of the S. I. with an
alphabetical index of articles</i>, by William J. Rhees (Washington,
1882), constitutes no. 478 of its series.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The early management of the Smithsonian decided that
the “knowledge” of its founder meant science, and from
the start gave not a little attention to archæology as a
science. When the Bureau of Ethnology became a part of
the Institution, and its <i>Reports</i> included papers necessarily
historical as well as archæological, the way was prepared
for a broader meaning to the term “knowledge,” and as
a significant recognition of the allied field of research the
present government of the Smithsonian gave hearty concurrence
to the act of Congress which in Dec., 1888, made
also the American Historical Association, which had existed
without incorporation since 1884, a section of the
Smithsonian Institution.</p>

Its mound explorations have been conducted by Cyrus
Thomas; those among the Pueblos of the southwest by
James Stevenson (d. 1888); while Major Powell himself
has controlled personally the body of searchers in the linguistic
fields (<i>American Antiquarian</i>, viii. 32). It would
seem that its profession “to organize anthropological research”
is not to its full extent true, since the physiological
side of the subject seems to be left in Washington to the
Army Medical Museum.</p>

Field’s <i>Ind. Bibliog.</i>, no. 1379; Allibone’s <i>Dictionary</i>,

of the condemnation of the book is too sweeping, for
amid its ignorance, confusion, and indiscrimination there
is much to be picked out which is of importance. Cf.
Parkman’s <i>Jesuits</i>, p. lxxx; Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Man</i>,

(Philad., 1884) is, with some additional matter, a rearrangement
of Schoolcraft, the omission to acknowledge
which on the title-page being an unworthy bibliographical
deceit. Schoolcraft’s rivalry of Geo. Catlin and his ignoring
of Catlin’s work is commented on at some length by
Donaldson in the <i>Smithsonian Inst. Report</i>, 1885, part
ii. pp. 373-383.</p>

Sabin, xvii., no. 70354. The Congrès Archéologique
de France began its Séances générales in 1834, but the interest
of its <i>Comptes rendus</i> for Americanists is for comparative
illustration. The two volumes of <i>Mémoires de la
Société Ethnologique</i> (Paris, 1841-45) contain nothing bearing
directly on American archæology. Much the same may
be said of the <i>Annales Archéologiques fondées par Didron
aîné</i>, in 1844, and continued to 1870; of the <i>Bulletin Archéologique</i>
(1844-46) of the Athénæum Français, and of its continuation,

you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
